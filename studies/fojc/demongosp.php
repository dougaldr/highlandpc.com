Throughout the Gospels we are frequently exposed to incidents involving 
demons. Yet, according to pollster/analyst George Barna, 60% of our nations 
believes that, &quot;Satan is not a living being but is just a symbol of evil.&quot; 
Among this 60% are many who claim to be &quot;born-again Christians.&quot;</p>
<p>Of 
course many Americans reject the concept of Satan (and his demons) because they 
reject the supernatural, and therefore reject the Bible. But many Christians 
are so poorly read in the Scripture that they do not understand that the Bible 
clearly and frequently mentions these malevolent spirit beings throughout both 
Testaments.</p>
<p>
Satan was originally created as a holy angel, a cherub named, &quot;Lucifer,&quot; (Star 
of the Morning). According to <b>Isaiah 14</b>, <b>Ezekiel 28</b>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/luke1018.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Luke 10:18</a>,
and an implication from 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/rev124.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Revelation 12:4</a>, 
it seems that a third of the angels followed Lucifer 
in rebellion against God. Lucifer became Satan (the Adversary), and the fallen 
angels became demons.</p>
<p>
These fallen angels follow Satan as their Commander-in-chief. Unlike God, 
Satan can only be present in one location at a time. But through his network 
of perhaps millions (or billions?) of demons, he has representatives who carry 
out his schemes. Throughout Scripture, Satan is presented as the adversary of 
God, the nation of Israel, and genuine followers of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In 
the ministry of Christ, Jesus encountered many who were demon-possessed. 
Modern skeptics claim that these demons were just superstition, and that Jesus 
was merely accommodating the ignorance of His era (or that He was among the 
ignorant). Yet the Bible clearly displays a difference between illness and 
demonization. <b>Matthew 4:24</b> reads, &quot;....and people brought to him all who were 
ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, 
those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.&quot; Note that the 
Bible makes a distinction between those having seizures (some versions render 
this term, &quot;epileptics&quot;) and demonization. It was during the ignorance and 
superstition of the Middle Ages that such distinctions were blurred.</p>
<p>
Since demons were created as angels, they have personality (intellect, emotions, 
will, creativity). Some people were demonized by great numbers of demons, 
others by a single demon. Demons also have names or titles.</p>
<p>
Perhaps it was to hinder the work of Christ that so many Jews were 
demon-possessed in the first century. Or perhaps many Jews were dabbling in 
the occult, the chief means for becoming demonized. In modern times, 
demonization flourishes most where people are into the occult: voodoo, idol 
worship, animism, etc.. With the rise of the New Age, Satanism, and fortune 
telling in the U.S., it is very likely that demonization is on the rise in Uncle 
Sam's domain.</p>
