<p><sup>1</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Go to 
Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: 
&quot;Let my people go, so that they may worship me.&quot;
<sup>2</sup> If you refuse to let them go and 
continue to hold them back, <sup>3</sup> the hand 
of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your 
horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and sheep and goats.
<sup>4</sup> But the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> will make a distinction 
between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging 
to the Israelites will die.' &quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> set a time and said, 
&quot;Tomorrow the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> will do this in the land.&quot; <sup>6</sup> 
And the next day the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians 
died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
<sup>7</sup> Pharaoh sent men to investigate and 
found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart 
was unyielding and he would not let the people go.</p>
