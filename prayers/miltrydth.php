  <p>Our Father,
  <p>Although Your Son died to save our souls, we are reminded time and time
  again that others still die to preserve our freedoms and assure our security.
  <p>Although we hate even the idea of war, we know that cowering in a corner and
  playing the role of a victim is a worse fate than the tragedies and losses of
  war. But the price tag of freedom is so expensive! We know, deep down, that no
  one should have to pay such a price. How precious is each human being, designed
  in Your image! How can one whose life is so intertwined with ours, someone who
  has brought us so much joy and pride, be suddenly taken from us? It seems 
  impossible. We cannot believe it. We do not want to believe it. But we are
  forced, kicking and screaming, to face this tragic reality square in the face.
  <p>It is one thing to read of strangers from locations other than our own who have 
  died for our country. We honor them and appreciate them, but they are names 
  printed alongside two-dimensional photographs. The closer to home our losses, 
  the more the awful realities of war and terrorism overwhelm us. When it becomes
  “us” and not “them,” we are forced to remember that this world is still under 
  the Curse. Our Father, we ask you to comfort those families and friends who have
  made this ultimate sacrifice of their loved one. Although the honors of dying for
  one’s country and securing freedom are noble causes, this consolation does little
  when we are crushed within. A flag can honor a son or daughter lost to war, but it
  cannot replace that dear one, nor can it heal our broken hearts. A military salute
  can remind us of honorable service, but it cannot soothe the desperation in our
  souls or the sense of utter helplessness in our spirits. Somehow we feel we could
  have prevented all this, but we know we could not. Somehow we still believe we are
  experiencing a bad dream, only to wake up and find out that the nightmare is
  nothing less than reality.
  <p>But You, our Father, are the God of all comfort. You know the beginning from 
  the end. Although Your ways are mysterious, the cross proves Your love for us. 
  Life isn’t fair, but You, O Lord, are just. We have but two choices: to weather
  the storms with You or without You; the storms will come either way. We choose to
  embrace You and find strength in Your gracious comfort.
  <p>Lord, You understand the pain and agony of sacrificing a Son to benefit and 
  free others. You, our God, feel our grief. Since You know the pain in our hearts, 
  You can help us to hobble along, wounded as we are.
  <p>We have You. And in You, the Almighty and Compassionate One, we find the 
  promise of eternal life, a reunion of those who know You, and the pledge of an 
  eternal friendship. One day, it will all make sense to us.
  <p>We pray in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
