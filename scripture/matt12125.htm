<p><sup>21</sup> She will give birth to a son, 
and you are to give him the name Jesus, 
because he will save his people from their sins.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>22</sup> All this took place to fulfill 
what the Lord had said through the prophet: <sup>
23</sup>&quot;The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they 
will call him Immanuel&quot;—which 
means, &quot;God with us.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>24</sup> When Joseph woke up, he did 
what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.
<sup>25</sup> But he had no union with her until 
she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</p>
