<br>Specific Events</span>
<br>Election Time
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Our Father, God, we picture you upon your mighty throne, dwelling in
unapproachable light. You reign sovereign over the entire universe, yet you are
aware of each falling sparrow. You are conscious of every strand of hair upon
our heads, so it is not difficult for us to understand that you care about our
world and our nation. Your concern extends even to the elections at hand.</p>
<p>As believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, we thank you, Father, that we have
access to your throne of grace. Father, we ask you to have your will done in the
elections to come. We know that since we citizens vote, we do get exactly the
leaders we deserve, be they good, evil, or inconsistent. If we fail to vote, we
have lost our logical right to complain. If we vote foolishly, our nation
suffers the consequences in the long term; if we vote wisely, our vote is a
blessing to our population. So we ask for discernment.</p>
<p>We ask that we might accept the outcome, even if we disagree with the views
and policies of those elected. We know that ultimately you sit sovereign.&nbsp;
We do
not know whether your plans are to bless our nation or discipline us; to
continue to exalt us or to humble us. We do not know whether we need to hit
lower bottom before we begin to ascend upward. It is our prayer that we are on
the ascent, but what do we know of the future or your plans for our particular
nation?</p>
<p>Help us remember, Lord, that our nation is but 6% of the world's population.&nbsp;
Help us to remember that we live at a point of time. Your gospel and your
purposes are eternal, world-wide, and intricate beyond our ability to
comprehend. Let us remember that the world is broader than the land between our
shores and eternity longer than our vapor-like lifetime.</p>
<p>So guide us into your will as we vote. And whether the outcome proves to be a
blessing or a curse, we will rest in your sovereignty. You call us to be
faithful, responsible, wise, valuing most what you value most. You do not call
us to sit at the helm; you have not taken leave of your throne and left us in
charge. No, we must be faithful, trustworthy, responsible: nothing more, nothing
less.</p>
<p>We thank you, Father, for knowing us better than we know ourselves. You
realize our limitations. In turn, we realize that you are NOT limited.&nbsp;
Thank you
that you care. You set up and take down. You establish leaders and you remove
them. So, Sovereign Lord, if it be within your good pleasure, please bless our
nation and create within our people a hunger to know and obey you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We pray in Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
