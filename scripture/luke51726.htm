<p><sup>17</sup> One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and 
teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea 
and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him 
to heal the sick. <sup>18</sup> Some men came carrying a 
paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.
<sup>19</sup> When they could not find a way to do this because 
of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the 
tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup> When Jesus saw their faith, he said, 
“Friend, your sins are forgiven.” </p>
<p><sup>21</sup> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law 
began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can 
forgive sins but God alone?” </p>
<p><sup>22</sup> Jesus knew what they were thinking and 
asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? <sup>23</sup> 
Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up 
and walk’? <sup>24</sup> But that you may know that the Son of 
Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....” He said to the paralyzed man, “I 
tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.” <sup>25</sup> Immediately 
he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home 
praising God. <sup>26</sup> Everyone was amazed and gave praise 
to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things 
today.”</p>
