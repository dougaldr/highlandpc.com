<p><sup>8</sup> On that day the L<span>ORD</span>, will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so 
that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be 
like God, like the Angel of the L<span>ORD</span> going before them. <sup>9</sup> On that day 
I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem. <sup>10</sup> &quot;And I 
will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of 
Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look on me, the one they 
have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and 
grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son.</p>
