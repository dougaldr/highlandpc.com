<sup>25</sup> I do not want you to be ignorant of 
this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced 
a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
<sup>26</sup> And so all Israel will be saved, as 
it is written: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The deliverer will come from Zion; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> And this is 
my covenant with them <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I take away their sins.&quot; 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> As far as the gospel is 
concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is 
concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs, 
<sup>29</sup> for God's gifts and his call are 
irrevocable. </p>
