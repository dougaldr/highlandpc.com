<p><sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected by men,<br>
a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.<br>
Like one from whom men hide their faces<br>
he was despised, and we esteemed him not.<br>
<br>
<sup>4</sup> Surely he took up our infirmities<br>
and carried our sorrows,<br>
yet we considered him stricken by God,<br>
smitten by him, and afflicted.<br>
<sup>5</sup> But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br>
he was crushed for our iniquities;<br>
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,<br>
and by his wounds we are healed.<br>
<sup>6</sup> We all, like sheep, have gone astray,<br>
each of us has turned to his own way;<br>
and the L<span>ORD</span> has laid on him<br>
the iniquity of us all.<br>
<br>
<sup>7</sup> He was oppressed and afflicted,<br>
yet he did not open his mouth;<br>
he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,<br>
and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,<br>
so he did not open his mouth.<br>
<sup>8</sup> By oppression and judgment he was taken away.<br>
And who can speak of his descendants?<br>
For he was cut off from the land of the living;<br>
for the transgression of my people he was stricken.<br>
<sup>9</sup> He was assigned a grave with the wicked,<br>
and with the rich in his death,<br>
though he had done no violence,<br>
nor was any deceit in his mouth.<br>
<br>
<sup>10</sup> Yet it was the L<span>ORD</span>'s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,<br>
and though the L<span>ORD</span> makes his life a guilt offering,<br>
he will see his offspring and prolong his days,<br>
and the will of the L<span>ORD</span> will prosper in his hand.<br>
<sup>11</sup> After the suffering of his soul,<br>
he will see the light of life and be satisfied;<br>
by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,<br>
and he will bear their iniquities.<br>
<sup>12</sup> Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,<br>
and he will divide the spoils with the strong,<br>
because he poured out his life unto death,<br>
and was numbered with the transgressors.<br>
For he bore the sin of many,<br>
and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
