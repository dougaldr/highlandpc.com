<br>Death to Television, Death to Isolation
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>We just purchased a new TV, our first one with remote control. The
picture
is brighter and our options greater: we can even mute the sound or switch
stations when an obnoxious commercial appears. Our new set is nice, fresh
looking, and clean. But the programs are still made of the same old
garbage. Have you heard about the Cable TV dinners? Ninety-seven
choices,
but none of them are any good!
</p>

<p>
The Kokomo Tribune ran an AP article on February 7th titled &quot;TV Is Getting
Hotter, Sex Study Finds.&quot; The report found sexual content in 68% of the
1999-2000 shows studied. I don't know about you, but we Vasiceks tend to
watch reruns or videos. We have not watched a currently made show&#151;with
the
exception of Christie, Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, HGTV, documentaries,
or the like&#151;since Marylu and I have been married.
</p>

<p>
But it is not merely the content of television shows that is nasty, it is
also the quantity of time we watch TV that counts. Robert Putnam, in his
book, <u>Bowling Alone</u> (a book you will get tired of hearing me quote)
writes, &quot;Television is...the only leisure activity that seems to inhibit
participation in other leisure activities. TV watching comes at the
expense
of nearly every social activity outside the home, especially social
gatherings and informal conversations. The major casualties of increased
TV
viewing, according to time diaries, are religious participation, social
visiting, shopping, parties, sports, and organizational participation.... Television viewers are anchored at home, and they recognize that fact
themselves: heavy viewers generally agree that, 'I am a homebody.'&quot; (p.237)
</p>

<p>
In addition to becoming anti-social, heavy television watchers are nearly
twice as likely to suffer from headaches, indigestion, and sleeplessness as
are light watchers. The cousins of television, namely video games and
computers, provide addicts with similar social and physical handicaps. The
result: social isolation. The expression, &quot;Get a life!&quot; is
tailor made for
such as these! Don't let the actors on television live life for you, get
your own!
</p>

<p>
Putman's book talks about how social involvement produces &quot;social
capital.&quot; In communities with a lot of social capital, SAT scores are high, crime is
low, depression is lower, and people are healthier. A smoker who is
socially isolated would increase his chances for better health more by
becoming socially involved than he would by giving up the cancer sticks!
Psychologically, &quot;....the single most common finding from a half-century's
research on the correlates of life satisfaction, not only in the United
States but around the world, is that happiness is best predicted by the
breadth and depth of one's social connections.&quot; (p. 332). Put simply,
if
you are involved in church, clubs, neighborhood groups, give blood,
volunteer, play cards with friends, and read the community paper, odds are
that you will live longer, be happier, and be smarter. And, if others get
on that same bandwagon, odds are overwhelming that the community educational
results will rise, crime will go down, and your property values will go up.
</p>

<p>
According to Putnam, some of the most obvious indicators that one is
socially connected include daily reading of the newspaper (a strong
indicator), moderate amounts of television (with news included and choice of
PBS sorts of shows vs. situation comedies or talk shows), attending church
regularly, having people over for a visit, playing cards, participation in
civic organizations (PTA, etc.), voting, attending a club, serving as an
officer (club or church), and developing the attitude that &quot;most people can
be trusted.&quot;
</p>

<p>
Regarding the newspaper, Putnam writes, &quot;Compared to demographically
identical non-readers, regular newspaper readers belong to more
organizations, participate more actively in clubs and civic associations,
attend local meetings more frequently, vote more regularly, volunteer to
work on community projects more often, and even visit with friends more
frequently and trust their neighbors more.&quot; (p. 218).
</p>

<p>
The newspaper statistics are consistent with other statistics regarding
social involvement. The oldest generation (born before 1929) experiences a
paper-reading rate of 72%. Then, each generation declines, with Baby
Boomers at 48% and the youngest adult generation (born after 1960) at 27%.
(Note that this statistic does not change as groups age. When the
generation now in their seventies were in their 20's, they read the paper at
about the same 72% rate!) The same pattern holds for voting, volunteering,
entertaining guests, and church or civic involvement: the younger
generations keep more to themselves, trust society less, and contribute less
to the well-being of others. We are becoming a nation of socially isolated
people and that results in more crime, depression, cynicism, extremism
(social people tend to be more moderate) and lawsuits (people can no longer
work out their own differences because they have no meaningful relationships
with others).
</p>

<p>
Putnam praises church involvement as one of the best environments for
building relationships and developing leaders. He writes, &quot;...Regular
worshippers...are much more likely than other people to visit friends, to
entertain at home, to attend club meetings, and to belong to sports groups,
professional and academic societies, school service groups, youth groups,
service clubs, hobby or garden clubs, literary, art, discussion, and study
groups, school fraternities and sororities, farm organizations, political
groups....&quot;
</p>

<p>
Yet Putnam has a reservation or two. In the past, I have read others who
claim that evangelicals are concerned not with justice but &quot;just us.&quot;&nbsp;
Does
Putnam agree with this charge? It seems he does. &quot;Evangelicals
are more
likely to be involved in activities within their own religious community but
are less likely to be involved in the broader community.... Among
evangelicals, church attendance is not correlated with membership in
community organizations.&quot; Those are interesting thoughts. We do
need to
seek the Kingdom of God first, and it is right for us to put a priority upon
church involvement. But maybe we should also consider getting around in a
broader circle. Are we, perhaps, putting a bushel over this little light
of
ours?
</p>

<p>
Where do we start? Read the paper, cut down on TV viewing, and talk to
your
neighbors. Within the church, get involved in a flock group or volunteer
for a ministry. As the World War II generation attempts to pass the baton,
perhaps the Christian community can become the last segment of society that
will be able to show people how to get a life&#151;but only if we learn to enjoy
people more than we enjoy the tube.
