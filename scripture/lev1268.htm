<p><sup>6</sup> &quot; 'When the days of her purification for a son 
or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent 
of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for 
a sin offering. <sup>7</sup> He shall offer them before the 
L<span>ORD</span> to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her 
flow of blood. </p>
<p>&quot; 'These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a 
girl. <sup>8</sup> If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring 
two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin 
offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be 
clean.' &quot; </p>
