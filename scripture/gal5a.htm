<p><sup>16</sup>So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the
desires of the sinful nature. <sup>17</sup>For the sinful nature desires what is
contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature.
They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want. <sup>18</sup>But
if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, <sup>23</sup>gentleness and self-control.
Against such things there is no law. <sup>24</sup>Those who belong to Christ
Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. <sup>25</sup>Since
we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.</p>
