<p>I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to
judge.&nbsp; And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their
testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God.&nbsp; They had not worshiped the
beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their
hands.&nbsp; They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>
