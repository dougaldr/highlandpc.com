<p><sup>13</sup> You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone
adorned you: ruby, topaz and emerald, chrysolite, onyx and jasper, sapphire,
turquoise and beryl.&nbsp; Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day
you were created they were prepared.&nbsp; <sup>14</sup> You were anointed as a
guardian cherub, for so I ordained you.&nbsp; You were on the holy mount of God; you
walked among the fiery stones.&nbsp; <sup>15</sup> You were blameless in your ways
from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you.&nbsp; <sup>16</sup>
Through your widespread trade you were filled with violence, and you sinned.&nbsp;
So
I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God ,and I expelled you, O guardian
cherub, from the fiery stones.&nbsp; <sup>17</sup> Your heart became proud on account
of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor.&nbsp; So I
threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.</p>
