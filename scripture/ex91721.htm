<p><sup>17</sup> You 
still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
<sup>18</sup> Therefore, at this time tomorrow I 
will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was 
founded till now. <sup>19</sup> Give an order now 
to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of 
shelter, because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been 
brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.' &quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> Those officials of Pharaoh who 
feared the word of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock 
inside. <sup>21</sup> But those who ignored the 
word of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> left their slaves and livestock in the field. </p>
