<p><a href="http://memorequip.com/hpc/2016/Bible-memorization.php" target="offline" class="reg">HPC 2016 Memorization Initiative</a></p>
<p>Terry Watson will lead our congregation in memorizing one passage a 
month. An example passage would be 		
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john1467.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 14:6-7</a>.
Scripture memory is an important part of discipleship, and we would rather aim low and succeed 
rather than aim high and fail. Memorizing during part of our church 
service will not add a time commitment, and we believe success will 
breed success and build confidence perhaps resulting in a deepening walk 
with the Lord. It is true that younger people can memorize more readily, 
but we are aiming to help the not-so-young as well. We will provide 
verse cards for those who want to review verses during the week. We will 
be using the ESV, but you are not limited to that version.</p>

          <br><b>May-June 2018&#8212;Paul�s Second Missionary Journey (Acts 15:36-18:22)</b>
          <br><br><p>Paul began his second journey with a new, right-hand man, Silas.&nbsp;It wasn�t 
long until Timothy joined the team as a leader in training.&nbsp;Beginning in Asia 
Minor, the apostle was directed by God to head west rather than east.&nbsp;That 
direction changed the course of history. The modern world would be very 
different if Paul had gone East. Exorcisms, earthquakes, riots and fruitful 
ministry, including important church plants, was the order of the day.&nbsp;Join us 
as we examine the fascinating story of Paul�s Second Missionary Journey.</p>
