<p>Great King of the Universe,</p>
<p>Thank You that You are the God Who protects us. <b>Psalm 91</b>, 
a Psalm of protection, gives us an example of Your protection when it is Your 
will to do so: &quot;If you make the Most High your dwelling容ven the 
L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, who is my refuge葉hen no harm will befall you, 
no disaster will come near your tent. For he will command his angels concerning 
you to guard you in all your ways&quot; (<b>vs. 9-11</b>). Sometimes You remove 
Your hand of protection and other times Your protection is limited. Satan was 
allowed to bring disaster upon Job, but only within limits. We cannot see the 
angels You send to guard us, or the disasters that would overtake us had You 
not exercised Your divine veto.</p>
<p>Lord, You have a goal, a purpose for my life. You want all 
of Your children to bring You glory, but You do this in differing ways. Help me 
to reflect upon Your purpose for my life. Help me to nurture my spiritual walk 
with You by spending time in Your Word, in prayer and in fellowship with other 
Christians who are serious about serving You and building up Your Kingdom.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You 
today. They are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I am thankful for many things, three of which are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may fill me. May I find my 
strength in His power, not my own. May Your Spirit control me&nbsp;today. So, Holy 
Spirit, stir me up, motivate me and continue to conform me to the character of 
Jesus Christ. Change me day by day, little by little.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to become more dependent upon You to help me 
do what I cannot do alone. Help me become a person of faith, a person who trusts 
You with the details of life. Help me view my life as an adventure with You and 
to be willing to walk through those open doors. Do not allow me to cower in the 
corner, strapped by fear.</p>
<p>Today I pray for the Republic of South Africa. Thank You 
that over 19% of the population claim to be born-again evangelicals. 
Additionally, there are many born-again believers in non-evangelical 
denominations. Thank You that, although the society has left its Christian 
morality, the true Christians are growing in strength and numbers. We pray not 
only that the growing number of believers would improve the moral climate, but 
also that they might win many to the Kingdom of God by the power of Your 
Spirit! Help the church to minister to those suffering from AIDS and help the 
believers to exemplify Christ-likeness.</p>
<p>I praise You, O Lord, for Children of Promise 
International, &quot;an interdenominational Christian mission organization dedicated 
to three areas of ministry: Caring for orphans and widows through church-based 
orphan homes, reaching the unreached with the Gospel of Jesus Christ through 
church planting and providing for needy children through feeding and nutrition 
programs, free schools and higher education opportunities, and family 
assistance.&quot; O God , bless this ministry as they serve You.</p>
<p>Please help me remember that You are there for me today, I ask in the Messiah's 
Name, Amen.</p>
