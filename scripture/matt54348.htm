<p><sup>43</sup> &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and
hate your enemy.'&nbsp; <sup>44</sup> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for
those who persecute you, <sup>45</sup> that you may be sons of your father in
heaven.&nbsp; He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on
the righteous and the unrighteous.&nbsp; <sup>46</sup> If you love those who love you,
what reward will you get?&nbsp; Are not even the tax collectors doing that?&nbsp;
<sup>47</sup>
And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others?&nbsp; Do not
even pagans do that?&nbsp; <sup>48</sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly
Father is perfect.</p>
