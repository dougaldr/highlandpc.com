<br>A Few Hot-Potato Questions

<p>Are you ready for the issues that are likely to come your 
way?&nbsp;I have concluded it is impossible to preclude everything, but we can 
address some common ones. Today I want to share my answers to a few common 
questions. This is a case of &#34;thus saith Pastor Ed,&#34; not &#34;thus saith the Lord.&#34;
</p>
<p><b>QUESTION:&nbsp;Is it wrong for a Christian to be cremated?&nbsp; </b></p>
<blockquote>Assuming he is dead, my answer is &#34;no.&#34; That was easy.&nbsp;But I do have a few other comments.&nbsp;The traditional way we bury our dead 
(viewing, funeral, graveside, etc.) serves a practical purpose: it helps loved 
ones and friends accept the reality that the deceased is...well, dead.&nbsp;In most 
instances, I think it is better, psychologically, to view a body.</p>
<p>People try to build Biblical arguments against cremation, 
but their reasoning is flimsy and betrays that they are advocating a 
preconceived agenda.</blockquote>
<p><b>QUESTION: Is it wrong to commit suicide? Will a true 
believer lose his salvation if he does so?</b></p>
<blockquote>I answer the first question &#34;yes,&#34; the second &#34;no.&#34;&nbsp;Suicide is usually an incredibly self-centered act.&nbsp;It destroys the consciences 
of friends and loved ones, burdening them down with a heavy&nbsp;load of guilt; it 
ruins lives. It is cowardly: committing suicide is running from life.&nbsp;It 
denies the ability of the Lord to help us through life. It frustrates the goal 
of our lives: glorifying God in times both good and bad.&nbsp;If you are 
contemplating suicide, get professional help immediately.</p>
<p>I am more sympathetic, but not supportive, when someone 
commits suicide because he is a danger to others (e.g., a serial killer) or has 
a terminal disease, though such a suicide is still truly wrong.&nbsp;The taking of 
human life, other than in self-defense, combat, or capital punishment, is a 
serious sin.</p>
<p>The second question deals with the security of the 
believer. If a truly saved person commits suicide, will he lose his salvation?&nbsp;The answer to all questions like this is &#34;no.&#34;&nbsp;Salvation is by grace, and 
nothing can separate the genuine, and I want to emphasize &#34;genuine,&#34; believer 
from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;I cannot imagine the 
shame and grief and loss of reward of the true believer who does this when he 
appears before the Judgment Seat of Christ.</p>
<p>Many of us have, at times, felt like we would rather be 
dead, especially on rainy Mondays.&nbsp;That is normal during life&#39;s low times.&nbsp;There is a big difference between that experience and actually planning to 
commit suicide.&nbsp;Even Paul talked about how he preferred to be with Christ 
rather than continue with life on earth, but he submitted to God&#39;s will over his 
own.&nbsp;David could not wait unit he could actually meet with God.&nbsp;But suicide is 
a rejection of God&#39;s will and a lashing out at God.</blockquote>
<p><b>QUESTION:&nbsp;Is it wrong for Christians to get married by a 
judge and not by a minister?</b></p>
<blockquote>No, it's fine. Getting married in church did not start 
until centuries after the church began.&nbsp;You are just as married if you were 
married by a judge or the captain of a ship as if you were married by Billy 
Graham himself.&nbsp;You are married when: (1) the society recognizes you as legally 
married and (2) you need to get a divorce to marry someone else.</p>
<p>I do have a few cautions to mention, however.&nbsp;First, 
studies have shown that a good pre-marital counseling regimen can cut the 
divorce rate for the first seven years of marriage by fifty percent.&nbsp;So make 
sure you get good premarital counseling even if you tie the knot in court.</p>
<p>Secondly, God&#39;s rules for marriage always apply:&nbsp;no sex 
until you are married, marry only a serious born-again believer if you are a 
serious believer yourself, and honor God&#39;s Word in your marriage.</p>
<p>Many Christians prefer to get married in church as a way to 
publicize that they want Christ to be Lord of their marriage, and that&#39;s great; 
but countless church weddings are done out of protocol or tradition only.&nbsp;What 
really matters is this: Is Jesus Christ Lord of your life and Lord of your 
marriage?</blockquote>
<p><b>QUESTION: How do we treat people who are living together 
but not married?</b></p>
<blockquote>Why did you have to ask this one?&nbsp;Okay, I&#39;ll tackle it, 
but this one is a bear to answer, and I do not know that I can address every 
situation. In some cases, no matter what I decide, I still feel wrong on some 
point.&nbsp;I&#39;ll list a few thoughts and then you can attempt to put it together. I 
can&#39;t always do that.</p>
<ol><li>We should not expect lost people to act like Christians, 
nor should we force them to do so.</p>
<li>We should expect Christians to act like Christians.</p>
<li>It is not our job to force anyone to conform to God&#39;s 
Word, but we are to hold other BELIEVERS&nbsp;accountable, even to the point of 
church discipline.&nbsp;Discipline&#39;s goal is to awaken them to the reality that they 
are straying from God, and that they need to get right with God first and then, 
as a consequence, they correct their behavior.&nbsp;We are not to hold lost people 
accountable.</p>
<li>What is morally wrong is wrong; it is not a case of 
being wrong for me and right for you.</p>
<li>We have to live in this world and should not isolate 
ourselves, but we should protect our children from harmful influences and 
examples that might be interpreted as &#34;living together apart from marriage is 
okay.&#34; Yet, if we have family members or friends who are doing so, we just may 
have to repeatedly discuss things with our kids, admonishing them that the 
couple is wrong and praying that they would come to know Christ.&nbsp;Children need 
to be told NOT to confront them; that is not their place.</p>
<li>We win people to Christ by sharing the Gospel and being 
gracious, not by demanding unbelievers to get in line first.</p>
<li>We should expect believers to &#34;get in line.&#34;</p>
<li>The welfare of children is crucial, so we must often 
choose between the lesser of evils. If a shacking-up couple have children 
together but one party refuses to marry, would it be better to continue the 
relationship for the kids or see them break up? </p>
</ol><p>These are just some of the issues we struggle with. Sin 
starts out simply, but results in horribly entangling messes, often hurting 
everyone involved.&nbsp;This sometimes leaves us searching for the lesser of evils 
rather than the best of the good.</p>
<p>One of the great challenges for Christians today is to 
recognize that society no longer feels obligated to embrace Judeo-Christian 
values. On the one hand, we have to get more comfortable with unbelieving 
couples who are shacking up while, at the same time, getting firm with believers 
(even in our own families) who are doing the same. We tend to reverse matters.</p>
<p>The other 
complicating factor is this: for most overt sins, we encourage Christians to fix 
matters immediately.&nbsp;When a couple has been living together for some 
time and they want to get right with God, sometimes repentance is taking the 
first step toward marriage (scheduling a date and getting premarital 
counseling).</blockquote>
