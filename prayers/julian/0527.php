<p>Great God,</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is called, &quot;The Wisdom of God&quot; (<b>1 Corinthians 
1:24</b>). Lord, those who refused to believe often viewed Jesus as foolish, a 
friend of tax collectors and sinners, and One who was out to create chaos and 
anarchy. After His resurrection, His disciples preached that Jesus came to give 
His life on the cross as our atoning sacrifice for our sins and the sins of the 
world. But the preaching of the cross was foolishness to them that perish, but 
to us, Jesus Christ truly is the Wisdom of God.</p>
<p>O, Lord, please help the hurting, the emotionally 
wounded and the devastated. Strengthen those stung by disappointment, 
encourage the demoralized and bind up the emotionally wounded. Especially help: __________.
</p>
<p>Lord, help me to be moderately organized. For some folks 
this comes naturally, for others, it is contrary to who they are. But balance 
is the key. Help me to be moderate in all things and to experience that part of 
the fruit of the Spirit known as self-control. I know that the playing field is 
not level and it is easier to control myself in some areas than others, while 
other people may struggle in areas that seem easy for me to control.</p>
<p>Father, I remember persecuted believers everywhere. Many 
thousands have died for their faith over the last few decades and the war of 
abuse continues. Help believers in countries where persecution is part of 
government policy—or where the government encourages others to do the 
persecution and looks the other way—to be especially wise at averting it. 
Help those who cannot avoid persecution without denying Christ to be strong and 
firm. Empower them for the trials that await them. We pray that the persecutors 
would themselves be won to Christ and that persecuting nations would be won 
over to the idea of true religious freedom. We pray especially for Sudan, 
China, Saudi Arabia, North Korea and Viet Nam—the Muslim and Communist world 
in general. Lord, please intervene as Your children suffer and die for the 
Gospel.</p>
<p>Sovereign One, I pray for the small European nation of 
Luxembourg. Only .3% of the population claim to be born-again evangelical 
Christians. Help efforts to translate the Bible into Letzebueresch, the native 
language of most residents. Create an appetite for the true God by Your Spirit, 
O Lord. May the evangelical church triple over the next decade!</p>
<p>O Lord, bless Evangelize China Fellowship whose 
mission is &quot;to 
present the whole gospel for the whole person in the whole world in order to 
fulfill the great commission of our Lord Jesus Christ. 'ECF' stands for the 
three major Ministerial approaches of ECF, Inc. namely: evangelism, charity and 
fundamental education.&quot; Lord, such a monumental task! With well more than one 
billion people in China, ECF has a mighty task. But You are an Almighty God. 
Empower them by Your Spirit, provide for them, protect them, grant them a spirit 
of unity and harmony and give them the wisdom that comes from above. Send 
angels to guard them.</p>
<p>Now, Lord, help me complete whatever tasks You have for me 
today, I pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
