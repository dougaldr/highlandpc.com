<p>My Faithful Master,</p>
<p>You are the God of peace; You are at peace with Yourself and through 
Christ’s death, we now have peace with You. But You also help me to experience 
peace because You love to share Your peace with Your Children. When I present my 
cares to You, You provide me with Your peace. You are always confident; You are 
righteous in all Your ways. Father, I cannot imagine what You are like. You know 
the outcomes of all things, so You never worry and You never guess. At the same 
time, You feel compassion for me, even though I often guess and often worry. You 
are an oasis of peace and a break from the chaos of life. Thanks for Your peace. 
Help me to avail myself of it more frequently.</p>
<p>I pray for my lost friends and family members including: __________.
Father, please send Your Spirit to draw them to Yourself and grant&nbsp;them the 
repentance that leads to life.</p>
<p>I pray for the elderly, sickly, and shut-in, including: __________.</p>
<p>Help me to be an alert Christian, Lord. I do not want to 
be numbered among those who value peace so much that I keep my head in the sand 
or deny undesirable realities. No, I need to understand how I am led into sin, 
how the devil tempts me and to have answers for the questions people are 
asking. I need to read, study and tool up as one of Your workers. I can 
neither rest on my laurels nor live in the past, for You have placed me in 
today's world. That means You want me to address today's challenges. Help me 
to be brave and to do so, I ask.</p>
<p>Father, I pray for our president, governor, federal and 
local senators and representatives and judges of all kinds. Help them to do 
what is right, to seek You and to please You.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the city or town in which I live (or the nearest such 
place). Father, I pray that many in this city/town would come to know You. May 
the number of true believers grow at least 50% over the next decade. Send Your 
Spirit to draw men, women and young people to Yourself. Help me to be a 
faithful witness to Your saving grace there. Although You have not called all 
of us to be missionaries—to cross cultures, You do call each of us to be Your 
witnesses and to share Your Gospel. Help me to do so, O Lord.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for the ministry of International Christian Ministries and 
their important work with the African Church! &quot;ICM exists in order to serve the 
church by discipling and equipping its leaders.... ICM envisions a future where a 
mature African Church leads the global Church in fulfilling the Great Commission 
through the practical application of the Great Commandment.&quot; Lord, bring unity 
and harmony to the African church through this and other ministries, I pray. 
Help them to mobilize the church to take ownership of the Great Commission for 
their continent. May they send out translators, evangelists and trainers to 
seed, nurture and repair the body of Christ there. Bless them, I ask!</p>
<p>Help me to remember to be about Your business, I also ask in Jesus’ Name, 
Amen.</p>
