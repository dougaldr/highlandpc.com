<br>Does 2 Peter 1:3-4 Teach That the Only Source for Counseling Truth Is Scripture? 
And Why I Think Nouthetic Counseling Misses the Mark
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<p>In this paper, I intend to demonstrate that <b>2 Peter 1:3-4</b> 
does not limit truth—or truth usable for counseling—to the Scriptures. In my 
opinion, the Nouthetic interpretation (that Biblical truth is sufficient for 
counseling philosophy and direction, or, as Jay Adams says, God has given us 
&quot;everything,&quot; <i>The Christian Counselor's Manual</i>, p. 83) is forced and 
contrived; I will argue that it runs contrary to Peter’s intent. I recognize 
that this passage is not the only one used by Nouthetic counselors to support 
their viewpoint, but this passage is usually cited first and thus foundational.</p>
<p>I write as one committed to the Scriptures as the 
infallible, inerrant Word of God. But I recognize the Scriptures as the canon—the 
measuring stick—of truth. Some “outside” proposed truths are affirmed by 
Scripture, others proposed truths are contradicted by Scripture (and thus 
false), while the Scripture gives us no ruling for countless other proposed 
truths. Nouthetic counselors (in actual practice) often do not recognize this 
third category: possible truth apart from Scripture. I will admit this: we can 
be sure of Scriptural truth, whereas our levels of certainty vary for other 
proposed truths. I will admit that the Bible is the only source of <i>infallible</i> 
truth, but I believe there are other potentially <i>fallible</i> sources of 
truth, some of which can be extremely insightful (as can life experiences). <b>
I am for a system of counseling that is held accountable to the Word of God, but 
not one limited to the contents of the Word of God. </b></p>
<b>The Text</b>
<p><i><b>2 Peter 1:3-4</b> reads</i>, &quot;His divine power has given us 
everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who 
called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his 
very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in 
the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil 
desires.&quot;</p>
<ol><li>First of all, let’s look at the term, &quot;everything.&quot; The 
Greek word is literally, &quot;all,&quot; and the idea of &quot;things&quot; is rightly supplied. 
But &quot;all things&quot; can easily mean &quot;all sorts of things.&quot; But this text does not 
force us to the point of saying &quot;everything we need in life is provided by the 
Scriptures, and no other significant additions can be made.&quot; Indeed, whenever 
we teach the word, something else (namely, &quot;we teachers,&quot;) has been added! So 
should we eliminate all teachers of the Word as unnecessary and merely read it 
aloud? Even an explanation of Scripture or an exposition of Scripture IS 
something <i>in addition</i> to the Scripture.</p>
<p>When we understand God as the Savior of all men, for 
example, we understand this to mean that He has provided salvation for all (but 
nonetheless all mankind is NOT saved), or that He has saved all types of men, or 
that He has saved all the men He has chosen. But we do not abuse the text to 
teach universalism because we recognize that “all” <i>does not always mean 
everyone without exception or without an additional condition</i>. We need to 
apply the same standard to the <b>2 Peter</b> passage. (Also see 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john1820.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 18:20</a> or 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/col412.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Colossians 4:12</a>
where &quot;always&quot; means regularly or frequently, not &quot;always&quot; in 
the sense of night and day 24/7.)</li>
<li>Secondly, this “everything” is said to come from God's 
divine power, <b>not necessarily</b> by the Word of God (or the Word <b>alone</b>). 
Although the Word is powerful, God’s power is sometimes manifested apart from 
His written Word. In his introduction to <b>2 Peter</b>, John Gill understands this to 
mean, &quot;everything necessary to a spiritual and godly life had been given them in 
the effectual calling.&quot; Gill sees the focus of this grant (what His power has 
given) to refer to God's effectual calling, which results in regeneration and 
salvation. This calling, then, becomes the foundation for all spiritual 
progress.</p>
<p>Calvin understood this passage as follows: &quot;<i>According as 
his divine power</i>. He refers to the infinite goodness of God which they had, 
already experienced, that they might more fully understand it for the future.&quot; 
So Calvin understands this to refer to the blessings given by God’s good grace. 
No doubt providing the Word as <b>one </b>of those things, but the text does not 
limit it thusly.</li>
<li>Third, let’s look at the phrase, &quot;pertaining to life and 
godliness.” Calvin comments:</p>
<blockquote>&quot;That pertain to life and godliness, or, as to life and 
godliness.<b> Some think that the present life is meant here</b>, as godliness 
follows as the more excellent gift; as though by those two words Peter intended 
to prove how beneficent and bountiful God is towards the faithful, that he 
brought them to light, that he supplies them with all things necessary for the 
preservation of an earthly life, and that he has also renewed them to a 
spiritual life by adorning them with godliness. <i>But this distinction is 
foreign to the mind of Peter</i>, for as soon as he mentioned life, he 
immediately added godliness, which is as it were its soul; for God then truly 
gives us life, <b>when he renews us</b> unto the obedience of righteousness. So 
Peter does not speak here of the natural gifts of God, <b>but only mentions 
those things which he confers peculiarly on his own elect above the common order 
of nature.&quot;</b></blockquote>
<p>Calvin rightly makes a distinction between what the 
believer has and what the unbeliever does not have. <i>Whatever Peter says God 
has given us, He has not given to the unsaved</i>.</p>
<p>Peter could very well have meant, &quot;God has granted to us 
everything necessary for salvation—eternal life—and its evidence, 
godliness.&quot; At least, Calvin seemed to take it this way. <b>If such is the case, 
then the &quot;all things&quot; refer to &quot;all things necessary for salvation.&quot;</b> This 
would then connect to the concept of an effectual call, &quot;who called us by his 
own glory and goodness&quot; (<b>1:3b</b>).</li>
<li>Fourth, we can understand &quot;through these&quot; to refer to 
His glory and goodness. So in His glory and goodness, He gave us his &quot;very great 
and precious promises.&quot; <b>The promises of God are not the same as &quot;the Word of 
God.&quot; </b>&nbsp;Only a small portion of the Bible contains actual <i>promises</i>. 
Additionally, these promises are only valid to the true believer. Whereas many 
unregenerate people have improved their lives and behavior by Bible study, etc., 
what Peter is speaking of here is limited to those whose &quot;calling and election 
is sure.&quot; So if Nouthetic counselors believe that the only appropriate source 
for counseling philosophy is the Bible, <i>they must argue the case (and argue 
it well) that the promises of God refer to <b>all </b>of Scripture</i>. This 
would be particularly difficult to do, since not all the Scriptures were yet 
completed before <b>2 Peter</b> was written. <b>Peter speaks of God already having 
given us “everything necessary” by the time 2 Peter was written, </b>so <b>2 Peter</b> 
itself could not be included, nor would <b>Revelation</b>, <b>John’s Gospel</b>, 
<b>Jude</b>, or 
<b>John’s epistles</b> (all generally thought to be written later than <b>2 Peter</b> by 
conservatives). No, the most natural rendering is that Peter is 
referring to promises relating to salvation and its resultant effect on our 
lives.</li>
<li>Fifth, the promises of God help us to participate in the 
Divine Nature. <i>They are nowhere said to be the solution for all of life's 
ills.</i> The focus here is a particular aspect of the believer's life, not life 
in its comprehensive—or even in its inter-personal relational sense. Although 
participating in the Divine Nature could and should have tangible, practical 
implications, Peter is limiting himself.</p>
<p>To participate in the Divine Nature is not the same as 
becoming part of the Divine Nature. Our new nature, our new relationship to God 
under the New Covenant, and our sanctifying walk with God, empowered by the Holy 
Spirit, is probably what Peter had in mind. Participating in the Divine Nature 
is the opposite of being corrupted by the world via our fleshly nature. So we 
do see here the concept of a sort of general sanctification in the life of the 
believer, but nowhere are we told that this sanctification between God and the 
individual (itself) will conquer depression or untangle our relationships. If 
such were the case, for example, there would be no need for the ministry of the 
church<i>. So the promises alone don't cut it</i>.</li></ol>
<p><b>Is Every Issue A Purely Spiritual One?</b></p>
<p>Is the believer's life to be segmented? <b>If not, then 
all aspects of our being should be covered here</b>. So if God has granted me <i>
everything pertaining to life and godliness</i>, and if &quot;everything&quot; means 
literally &quot;everything without exception,&quot; then why should I seek a doctor when I 
am ill? Or is my physical life not part of &quot;everything?&quot; Are all aspects of my 
wellbeing in mind here? There is nothing in <b>2 Peter</b> about an appendix surgery, 
something that might have a great impact on my life, my ministry, my family, 
and, for that matter, how long I live! <b>So everything cannot mean 
&quot;everything&quot; in this life</b>, as Calvin rightly concluded (see above). It 
means, rather, &quot;everything pertaining to <i>eternal </i>life.&quot;</p>
<p>The argument that there is no justification for dividing 
the spiritual from the relational or psychological cannot be simply shrugged 
off. But to make simplistic statements that all relational or behavioral 
problems (for example) are necessarily spiritual ones is to assume an awful lot.
<b>It ignores what we may not know</b>. When we do not know, we are at a 
disadvantage; but when we do not know that we do not know, we are in deep 
trouble.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: Let’s suppose Nouthetic counseling 
made its debut in 1850. A man we <b>now</b> describe as bipolar comes in for 
help. In our day and age, Jay Adams (founder of Nouthetic counseling) recognizes 
that (at least some) bipolar individuals have an organic problem, a lack of 
lithium; we recognize that they cannot always help their problem without 
medication. </p>
<p>But would Nouthetic counselors have known that in 1850? Or 
would the counselor have lectured the counselee about being conformed to the 
image of Christ, given him some Bible verses, set up an accountability system, 
and advocated &quot;godliness through discipline?&quot; When counseling failed, the 
counselor would merely write it off as another case of an excuse maker not 
taking responsibility for himself. A scene like that <i>could </i>have happened 
in 1850. But people in 1850 knew there were a lot of mysteries involving the 
human brain and body, <b>so they left room for the unknown</b> and did the best 
they could. And this humility is what modern Nouthetic counseling lacks.</p>
<p><b>How do we know that a similar situation is not happening 
today?</b> Perhaps a man is depressed, and that depression is caused by body 
and brain chemistry we do not yet understand. True, many depressed people are 
indeed depressed because of sinful patterns, but are they all? Adams leaves 
plenty of room for women experiencing PMS (because we can document hormone and 
chemical causes), but what about room for chemistry we have yet to discover? 
How do we <i>really</i> know what is organic (or genetic) and what is not?</p>
<p>All women are people. Are all people, therefore, women? 
Just because many counseling issues are sin-related, that does not mean there 
can be no other factors. In the sin-cursed world around us, there is not 
necessarily a correlation between a specific sin and tragedy, for example. All 
our problems can be traced to the Fall (and the curse), but not necessarily to a 
particular sin on our part. </p>
<p>Nouthetic counseling downplays the graduation of 
responsibility. Fear, for example, can sometimes be described as a lack of 
trust in God. But a woman, who, as a girl, was molested every time it stormed, 
is going to have more of a problem being afraid during a storm than someone who 
has not had such a traumatic background.</p>
<p>So if this woman learns to be less afraid during a storm 
(but still afraid), is she less godly than the woman who has never feared a 
storm? Not necessarily. When bottom line behavior becomes the main issue, we 
lose sight of where a person is coming from and how far he and she have come.</p>
<p>Let us postulate this story further. Let us suppose this 
traumatized woman has come to know Christ, repented of obvious sin, and is 
memorizing Scripture, praying, and serving in all sorts of ways. Let us 
introduce a second woman does not know Christ. The first woman is partaking of 
the Divine Nature while the second is not. The first woman is finding the 
courage to go on because she clings to the promises of God, but storms still 
bring out fear. Her problems are not all solved; they may never be; but she has 
put <b>2 Peter 1:3-4</b> to work. Yet the second woman never fears a storm. Is this 
lost second woman therefore more spiritually mature?</p>
<p>So is there a difference between the spiritual and what we 
might call the psychological? I think so. The spiritual undoubtedly affects 
the psychological. But I believe it is possible to excel spiritually while 
still not being completely &quot;normal&quot; psychologically. And it is very possible—no, I might say common—to be &quot;normal&quot; psychologically (or behaviorally) while 
being unsaved and thus dead spiritually. </p>
<p><b>If the way to address all psychological problems was to 
put the Word of God to practice, then we should expect those who ignore the Word 
to be much more psychologically messed up than those who are into the Word.</b> 
And the way to measure this is by Christian standards (as demonstrated in <b>1 
Timothy 3</b>): the husband of one wife, rearing children well, not given to 
argument, etc. <i>We soon discover that we have more divorces (and, in my 
opinion, more messed up people) with evangelicalism (where the Word is somewhat 
emphasized—admittedly not enough) than we do without</i>. What this implies is 
monumental: <b>the Word is not enough to make some messed up people normal, and 
the lack of God's Word does not necessarily make normal people messed up</b> 
(except in the spiritual realm, <i>a realm which could be defined as that 
difference between a decent lost person and a decent dedicated godly person</i>).</p>
<p><b>Definitions</b></p>
<p>So here we have a hazy division between the spiritual and 
the psychological. If we take a godly normal Christian and subtract a morally 
decent non-Christian, what is left is the spiritual. Where the two converge is 
the psychological. The psychological can alter the spiritual and the spiritual 
can alter the psychological, so there is plenty of overlap.</p>
<p><b>Maturity, A Key Issue</b></p>
<p>Additionally, we have confused <i>spiritual</i> maturity 
with maturity. <u>Most church conflicts, for example, are caused because people 
are not <b>relationally or personally</b> mature <i>as many decent lost people, 
though they may be more spiritually mature (in a sense, even newly saved people 
are more <b>spiritually</b> mature than any lost person)</i>.</u>&nbsp; <b>Therefore 
there must be something more involved in maturity than JUST spiritual maturity. 
These other elements of maturity can be best discovered by observation and 
study. </b>&nbsp;Some Christians are power mongers or touchy, while some lost people 
are reasonable and humble. </p>
<p>So we must understand that the Scriptures, applied by God's 
Spirit, can get us to a higher level in some ways, and certainly in the 
Spiritual realm. <u>But oftentimes we are working with Christians trying to 
bring them to the same level as decent lost people! So we need to pay 
attention to the way that lost people avoid having these problems in the first 
place</u>. To avoid using the language of psychology (mentally healthy) we might 
use terms like, &quot;mature and balanced.&quot; Observing human behavior in general is 
an important source of counseling information! Biblical principles 
should determine how we interpret human behavior, thus making a distinction 
between counseling that is at least not contradictory to Scripture from that 
which is based on humanistic (or other) paradigms.</p>
<p><b>Brain Studies</b></p>
<p>Biblical counselors should become familiar with brain 
studies. The difference between the male and female brain, how the brain 
changes, etc., are important considerations. Richard Restak's book, <i>The New 
Brain</i> is fascinating and insightful.</p>
<p><b>Genetic Studies</b></p>
<p>Genetic studies of identical twins raised apart are 
fascinating. Do genes argue for diminished levels of responsibility? Is there 
a difference between what is possibly and what is more likely for some than 
others? Can a man beget a fool, as the book of Proverbs seems to imply? What 
about autism? </p>
<p>Even secular sources like Dean Hammer will confess that our 
genes may predispose us to certain behaviors, but they do not predetermine our 
behavior. If you agree with that, then individuals are still responsible for 
their behavior, but some find it more difficult to resist certain sins than 
others. </p>
<p>Native Americans are biologically wired so that they easily 
fall into alcoholism. There seem to be clear-cut genetic factors in matters of 
weight, alcoholism, anxiety, etc. The playing field is not level, and it is 
important to understand how and why this is so. </p>
<p>We do have inherited personalities, and we often have to 
work within the parameters of who we are. Whether we categorize personalities 
(as Tim LaHaye does) or not, we must take this into account. I agree with Tim 
LaHaye, namely, that no man is destined to become a homosexual, but that men who 
have the &quot;melancholic&quot; temperament, when coupled with environmental factors, 
will find it <b>easier</b> to choose this sinful lifestyle, whereas the rest of 
us are not even tempted.</p>
<p>Like the apostles, Nouthetic counselors are too quick to 
ask, &quot;Who sinned, this man or his parents?&quot; Some counselors are worse: they 
will not even ask if the parents sinned! </p>
<p>Rather than close our eyes, we must learn to open them, to 
&quot;Test everything. Hold on to the good. Avoid every kind of evil&quot; (<b>1 Thessalonians 
5:21</b>). If I only stick to the Word of God, what would there be for me to test?</p></div>
