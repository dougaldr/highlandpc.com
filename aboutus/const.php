<p id="pgt">The Constitution of Highland Park Church
<br><span class=byln>Adopted June 21, 1992. Revised April 30, 2017.</span></p>

<p class="sctn">SECTION I: GOVERNMENT<p>
<p align="left"><b>Article I: Operational Policy and Character of the Church</b></p>
<p>Our fellowship shall be based on the clear and obvious truth of Scripture.&nbsp;
The head of this church shall be Christ; the decision-makers shall be the
elders; and the elders shall be accountable to the membership.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Article II: Membership</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Any person meeting the following requirements may be considered as a
    candidate for membership:</li>
   <ol type=a>
     <li>a profession of repentance toward God,</li>
     <li>a profession of dependence upon the work of Christ in His death, burial
      and resurrection as the only basis of forgiveness and
      salvation,</li>
     <li>general agreement with the doctrine and approach of Highland Park
      Church,</li>
     <li>a life not characterized by extreme hypocrisy (drug/alcohol abuse,
      immorality, spouse/child abuse, criminal activity, unethical business
      practices, etc.).</li>
    </ol>
  <li>A candidate for membership shall share his/her testimony with any current
    elder. The elder shall present a recommendation regarding the
    candidate to the board of elders, who may accept the candidate into
    membership.</li>
    </ol>
<p align="left">
    <b>Article III: Church Discipline and Accountability</b></p>
<p align="left">This section refers to members of Highland Park Church, not
unsaved people or non-members who attend (unless under discipline from another
evangelical church).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Church members shall be disciplined by the method and for the gross sin
    recorded in the following passages:
    <a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt181517.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 18:15-17</a>;
    <a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1cor51167.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1
    Corinthians 5:11-6:7</a>;
    <a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/gal19.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Galatians 1:9</a>;
    <a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/2thes31015.htm')" target=_self class=pop>2
    Thessalonians 3:10-15</a>
    and
    <a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/2john10.htm')" target=_self class=pop>2 John 10</a>.&nbsp;
    The elders shall be the final authority in all matters of discipline.<br>
  <li>Accountability principles require that members attend Highland Park Church
    on a fairly regular basis. Minimal regular attendance shall be defined
    as approximately twelve services per year. Members who neglect
    attending regularly shall be removed from the membership roll, unless
    exempted. Exemptions include shut-ins, elderly members, out-of-area
    members, members working Sundays, etc. Each situation shall be weighed
    by the elders.<br>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A member removed from the roll due to lack of attendance is
    welcome to fellowship with us and may reapply for membership when he/she is
    ready to become more involved in the church.</ol>
    <p align="left"><b>Article IV: Officers of the Church</b>
<ol>
    <li>A nominating committee consisting of eight to ten members shall meet
      annually, preferably in February, for the purpose of selecting candidates
      for office. This committee shall consist of two elders, two deacons,
      two deaconesses, and the remainder shall be non-office-holding members;
      all committee members shall be chosen by the elders. The committee
      shall be chaired by the senior pastor. The committee shall present
      its nominations to the elders. A screening form developed by the
      elders shall be distributed to the nominees. The completed screening
      form will assist the elders in evaluating the nominees (see
      <a href="#v5" target="rtop" class="reg">Article V, #5</a>). A list
      of the approved nominees shall be presented to the
      membership at the annual business meeting. Candidates must receive
      at least a two-thirds approval, written ballot, to confirm the position.<br>

      years.<br>
    <li>Officers shall be members of Highland Park Church. Teachers (for
      example, Sunday School and Children's Church), club directors, and club
      leaders are to be members as well. (Exceptions allowed if cleared by
      the elders.) Substitute teachers and helpers, though not required to
      be members, must abstain from sexual immorality, drunkenness and/or use of

<p align="left">
    <b>Article V: Limitations, Policies, and Accountability Checks</b>
<ol>
  <li>The church shall hold a regular business meeting at least once per
    quarter. The meeting date is to be determined by the elders and
    communicated to the congregation with at least one week advance notice.&nbsp;
    All church officers are expected to attend regular business meetings.<br>
  <li>Twelve members at a business meeting shall constitute a quorum. The
    elders, deacons, or twelve voting members may call a special business
    meeting. Two weeks notice shall be required for a special business
    meeting, except in an emergency.<br>
  <li>The church shall hold an annual meeting, preferably in April. Available
    church statistics shall be presented during this meeting. Additionally,
    candidates for office will be presented for confirmation.<br>
  <li>All officers seeking to resign shall give at least one month's notice to
    the elders unless resigning for moral, doctrinal, or crisis reasons.<br>
  <li><a name="v5"></a>Each candidate for office shall indicate his/her general
  agreement with
    the doctrine of our church.<br>
  <li>The deacons are the church's trustees but shall make no purchases without
    permission or delegated authority (and its accompanying limits) from the
    elders. The deacons shall not take out a loan or handle real estate
    without consent of the membership at a business meeting.<br>
  <li>The elders may not approve funds for any project exceeding one week's
    average offering (based on previous year) without permission from a
    two-thirds majority of the members present at a business meeting.<br>
  <li>All missionaries being considered by the church board for financial
    support must be approved by the elders and confirmed by a two-thirds
    majority at a business meeting.<br>
  <li>The board of elders or a two-thirds majority of the membership present at
    a business meeting may remove any officer from his/her office.<br>
  <li>If any office or position is vacated, the elders may appoint someone to
    serve until the next annual meeting.<br>
  <li>The elders&#39; board reserves the right to grant or refrain from granting 
    permission for any and all activities involving church properties. Highland 
    Park Church&#39;s property and facilities may be used only for purposes consistent 
    with the church&#39;s doctrinal beliefs as reflected in the Bible and spelled out 
    in this document, including its statements on morality, marriage, and human 
    sexuality. Property and facility use will not be permitted to persons or groups
    holding, advancing, or advocating beliefs or practices that conflict with 
    Highland Park Church&#39;s religious teachings as reflected in the Bible and this 
    document.<br>
  <li>Non-members of the church may be required to pay a fee for the use of
    church facilities.<br>
  <li>No drinking of alcoholic beverages shall be allowed on church properties.&nbsp;
    No smoking is allowed in the church building.&nbsp;<br>

    church-related home fellowship groups, Women's Missionary Society) shall
    answer to the elders and the membership.<br>
  <li>Guest speakers shall be in general agreement with the doctrinal statement
    of Highland Park Church.<br>
  <li>Men shall be taught doctrine or Bible content or be under the preaching of
    men only, whether in a service, Sunday School, or any official church
    function
    (<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1tim21115.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1
    Timothy 2:11-15</a>).&nbsp;
    For practical purposes, a man shall be
    defined as a male eighteen years or older. Women may teach
    non-doctrinal materials (Biblical geography, languages, teaching techniques,
    etc.) to men, as well as sharing testimonies or personal applications of
    Scripture. Women may lead songs, be involved in drama, usher, minister
    in music, and anything else not specifically limited to men in our
    understanding of Scripture or the Constitution. Women may teach Bible or
    doctrine to women or children.<br>
  <li>Voting members must be at least sixteen years of age.<br>
  <li>The elders shall interpret and apply this constitution.
  <li>All new pastoral staff will be given a probationary status during the first 
year of employment. Even though pastoral staff is approved by the congregation 
for a five-year term, new pastors will be evaluated during the first year of 
employment. During the probationary period, the elders shall either 
    <ol type=a>
      <li>confirm employment, 
      <li>terminate employment, or 
      <li>extend the probationary period. 
    </ol>
This applies to new pastors only during their first term of service. Once 
employment is confirmed, they may only be removed as described in Article V, point 9.
</ol>
<p align="left">
    <b>Article VI: Amendments</b>
<p align="left">
    This constitution may be amended at any time by a two-thirds majority of the
    membership present at a business meeting. It is suggested that this
    constitution be evaluated every five years for possible adjustments.</p>
<a name="sctnii">&nbsp;</a>
<p class="sctn">SECTION II: DOCTRINE (OUR BELIEFS)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Article I: The Holy Scriptures</b></p>

<p>We believe that the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the
twenty-seven books of the New Testament are verbally inspired by God and
inerrant in the original manuscripts. Scripture is the only infallible
source in determining matters of faith and practice.<br>

<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ps119a.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Psalm 119</a>)</p>
<p>
<b>Article II: God</b></p>
<p>
We believe that God is one unity made up of three distinct persons: Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit (the Trinity). Each person is equal in attributes. God is
present everywhere, has all knowledge and power, is holy and loving, had no
beginning and shall have no end.<br>

<p>
<b>Article III: The Lord Jesus Christ</b></p>
<p>
We believe that the Son of God has always existed as God. At a point in
time, He became man in the person of Jesus Christ. He was miraculously
conceived while Mary was yet a virgin. Though He became fully man, He also
remained fully God, although He limited Himself to the Father's wishes. He lived
a sinless life. He suffered physically and spiritually on the cross,
shedding His blood on behalf of mankind. His death satisfied the justice
and righteous wrath of God so that the believer can be forgiven in a way that
does not compromise God's character. On the third day, He rose bodily from
the grave. He later ascended into heaven to sit at the right hand of the
Father, where He intercedes on behalf of believers.<br>

<p>
<b>Article IV: The Holy Spirit</b></p>
<p>
We believe that God the Holy Spirit is active in the conversion process and that
He indwells and empowers every genuinely converted believer.<br>

Corinthians 6:11</a>)</p>
<p>
<b>Article V: Man</b></p>
<p>
We believe that man was created by God in His own image, meaning that man is a
moral and spiritual being. The first man chose to willfully disobey God,
and as a result the world is cursed and the image of God in man is damaged and
marred. The natural, unsaved man is spiritually dead and unable to deliver
himself from sin and eternal damnation.<br>

<p>
<b>Article VI: Salvation</b></p>
<p>
We believe that to be &quot;saved&quot; means to have one's sins (past, present,
and future) forgiven by God, to have become a new creation in Christ, and to be
delivered from hell and the power of sin. Salvation cannot be achieved
through personal effort, self-reform, or religious ritual. In order to be
saved, one must exercise saving faith by repenting from sin and trusting in what
Christ did on the cross to make us right with God.</p>
<p>
Saving faith depends upon the work of Christ, not what we can or cannot do.&nbsp;
No
other conditions are to be added (such as baptism, church membership, etc.) to
salvation. These practices may evidence genuine conversion, but they
cannot cause it.<br>

<p>
<b>Article VII: Assurance of Salvation</b></p>
<p>
We believe that every true believer can be sure of his/her salvation because
salvation is never earned or deserved; it is a gift, not a loan. The Holy
Spirit bears witness to our conversion, as does a changed life, but the
so-called carnal Christian is not entitled to assurance.<br>

<p>
<b>Article VIII: Perseverance (Security)</b></p>
<p>
We believe that if a person is truly saved, he will, without exception, continue
to believe until the end. The fruit of genuine conversion is endurance.&nbsp;
Although some who appear to be truly saved may not be actually saved, the Lord
knows His own. A person who truly possesses salvation cannot lose that
salvation, but a truly saved person cannot permanently live in gross sin.<br>

<p>
<b>Article IX: Spiritual Gifts</b></p>
<p>
We believe that every genuine believer has at least one spiritual gift and often
several. The Holy Spirit is sovereign and distributes gifts as He chooses.&nbsp;
He is under no obligation to give all types of gifts to every generation of
believers. We do NOT hold to the following:
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>It is always God's will for every believer to be physically healed in
      this life.<br>
    <li>Failure to be healed always indicates a lack of faith.<br>
    <li>Only those speaking in tongues have been baptized and/or filled with the
      Spirit.<br>
    <li>It is God's desire for all believers to speak in tongues.<br>
    <li>The gift of tongues is the most important spiritual gift.
  </ol>
<p>Although we do not endorse tongues as being a spiritual gift given today, we
will accept those who disagree into our membership as long as they do not hold
to the above beliefs and do not promote tongues.<br>

We believe that the Church is the living body of Christ and consists of all
true believers, regardless of denominational affiliation, who have genuinely
been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. The Church is a New
Testament entity, not a continuation of Israel. The individual (local)
church is a specific body of believers, gathered together to minister to one
another to the glory of God.
</p>
<p>
We observe two ordinances that remind us of the work of Christ: the Lord's
Supper and believer's baptism (by immersion). These ordinances are
edifying, but symbolic; they do not contribute toward salvation.<br>

  <p>
We believe that one day Jesus Christ will return to resurrect the dead in
Christ and to immortalize &quot;we who remain.&quot; We also believe that
there will
be a seven year period of God's wrath on the earth, called the Tribulation
or Daniel's 70th week. We believe that a literal millennium (thousand year
reign of Christ) will follow the Tribulation, during which God will once
again exalt His nation, Israel (premillennialism). We recognize the
diversity of opinion as regards the return of Christ to the clouds (the
&quot;rapture&quot;) and its relationship to the tribulation. Though our
position has
historically been that of Pretribulationalism, we can accept members with
other viewpoints.

<p align="left"><b>Article XVI: Morality</b></p>
<p>Our faith and moral standards cannot be separated; one leads to the other. 
We, therefore, take the following moral stands: 
<ol>
  <li>Marriage and Human Sexuality</li>
   <ol type=a>
     <li>We embrace the conviction that the family is a God-ordained institution, 
consisting of an exclusive heterosexual relationship within the bonds of 
marriage. The Church recognizes that marriage is the uniting of one 
biological man and one biological woman in covenant commitment before God. 
Accordingly, the Church, its pastors, staff and members will participate
neither in same sex unions or marriages nor unions or marriages involving 
a transgender individual, nor shall its property or resources be used for 
such purposes.</li>
     <li>The Bible teaches that legitimate sexual relations are to be exercised 
solely within marriage. We oppose all forms of sexual immorality among our 
members. At the same time, we wish to affirm that God forgives the 
repentant, and so must we. We recognize sexual purity is an on-going 
struggle, but struggling is not to be confused with surrendering. Thus we 
oppose cohabitation and encourage our members to establish safeguards in 
this area.

     <li>Pastors or other church leaders qualified to officiate weddings are 
never obligated to officiate a marriage or union (and may not be 
constrained to do so by either church or state); neither shall they be 
constrained to participate or bless a marriage. Because God has ordained 
marriage and defined it as the covenant relationship between a man and a 
woman, Highland Park Church will only recognize marriages between one 
biological man and one biological woman. Further, the ministers and staff 
of Highland Park Church shall only participate in weddings and solemnize
weddings between one biological man and one biological woman, and the 
facilities and property of Highland Park Church shall only host weddings
between one biological man and one biological woman. In addition, Pastors 
or other authorized leaders shall not be asked to violate their conscience; 
they may develop a covenant agreement expressing conditions and standards 
for officiating, based upon their studied Biblical convictions.
