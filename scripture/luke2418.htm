<p><sup>1</sup> On the first day of the week, very early in the 
morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
<sup>2</sup> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
<sup>3</sup> but when they entered, they did not find the body 
of the Lord Jesus. <sup>4</sup> While they were wondering about 
this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
<sup>5</sup> In their fright the women bowed down with their 
faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living 
among the dead? <sup>6</sup> He is not here; he has risen! 
Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:
<sup>7</sup> ‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands 
of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’”
<sup>8</sup> Then they remembered his words. </p>
