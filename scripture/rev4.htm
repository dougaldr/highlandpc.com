<p><sup>1</sup> After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing
open in heaven.&nbsp; And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet
said, &quot;Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after
this.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>2</sup> At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a
throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> And the one who sat
there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian.&nbsp; A rainbow, resembling an
emerald, encircled the throne.&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> Surrounding the throne were
twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders.&nbsp; They were
dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> From the
throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder.&nbsp; Before the
throne, seven lamps were blazing.&nbsp; These are the seven spirits of God.&nbsp;
<sup>6</sup>
Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as
crystal.</p>

<p>In the center, around the throne, were for living creatures, and they were
covered with eyes, in front and in back.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup> The first living creature
was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the
forth was like a flying eagle.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> Each of the four living creatures
had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings.&nbsp; Day
and night they never stop saying:</p>

<p>&quot;Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to
come.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to
him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, <sup>10</sup> the
twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him
who lives for ever and ever.&nbsp; They lay their crowns before the throne and say:</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> &quot;You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for
you created all things and by your will they were created and have their being.&quot;</p>
