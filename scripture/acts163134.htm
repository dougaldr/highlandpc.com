<p><sup>31</sup> They replied, &quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and
your household.&quot; <sup>32 </sup>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him
and to all the others in his house. <sup>33 </sup>At that hour of the night the
jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family
were baptized. <sup>34 </sup>The jailer brought them into his house and set a
meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in
God—he and his whole family.</p>
