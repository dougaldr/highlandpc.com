<p><sup>9</sup> As I looked,<br>
       thrones were set in place,<br>
       and the Ancient of Days took his seat.<br>
       His clothing was as white as snow;<br>
       the hair of his head was white like wool.<br>
       His throne was flaming with fire,<br>
       and its wheels were all ablaze.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> A river of fire was flowing,<br>
       coming out from before him.<br>
       Thousands upon thousands attended him;<br>
       ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.<br>
       The court was seated,<br>
       and the books were opened. </p>
