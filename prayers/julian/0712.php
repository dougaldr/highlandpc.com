<br>July 12

<p>King of Kings,</p>
<p>Lord, You are a father to the fatherless and a defender of widows 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ps685.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Psalm 68:5</a>). 
You become angry when people abuse the vulnerable and one 
day You will bring judgment upon those who do so. Father, although the 
unrighteous may seem to prosper, often their prosperity is short-lived. 
Eventually in this life or in eternity, You will right all wrongs because You 
are a just God. Even though Your martyred children in heaven call out for You 
to take revenge, You will do so only in Your time 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/rev6911.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Revelation 6:9-11</a>), 
but You will do so.</p>
<p>Lord, help me not to envy sinners; instead help me to be 
zealous for You 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/prov2317.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Proverbs 23:17</a>). 
Sometimes those who do not know You may be 
healthier, wealthier, or seemingly happier than me. Help me to remember that 
this is an illusion. Whether they show it or not—or face it or not—they 
have an emptiness I do not have. I know where I've come from, where I am going 
and my purpose in life—to glorify You. My life is not one constant 
distraction from the big issues! No, I have meaning and purpose and wisdom 
from You. Thank You, Lord. </p>
<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You 
today. They are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I am thankful for many things, three of which are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may fill me. May I find my 
strength in His power, not my own. May Your Spirit control me today.</p>
<p>Lord, the Gansu province of China, with about 26 million 
people, has only about 1.9% of the population who claim any form of 
Christianity. Although most of these are evangelical, Lord, so many need to 
hear of Christ and trust Him! Thank You that FEBC broadcasts have reached 
many. But because there are too few trained leaders, false sects are 
emerging. Lord, provide training and leadership and may Your Spirit draw many 
to Christ from this region. May evangelicals double over the next three years 
here, I pray.</p>
<p>The Guandong Province with its 73 million people also has a 
small percentage of evangelicals perhaps 1%. Persecution is especially heavy 
in this province. O Lord, may Your Gospel powerfully penetrate this province. 
May the percentage of believers double in this area over the next five years, I 
ask.</p>
<p>My Master, I pray for International Students, Inc. They 
&quot;exist to share Christ’s love with international students and to equip them for 
effective service in cooperation with the local church and others. [Their] 
vision is to see every international student befriended, led to a personal 
relationship with Jesus Christ and discipled for His service. There are over 
699,000 international students and scholars on U.S. university campuses today, 
from over 200 nations—the majority from restricted access nations that limit 
traditional missions (10/40 window nations.) They are lonely, spiritually hungry 
and incredibly strategic to the cause of Christ in their respective homeland. 
They will return home to make impact. ISI is mobilizing the Body of Christ in 
America so that their impact will be for Christ!&quot; Lord, prosper this work, I 
ask. Grant the leaders harmony and the power of Your Spirit.</p>
<p>Now empower me today, I ask in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
