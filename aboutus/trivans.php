<br>Highland Park Church Trivia Quiz:
<br>Answers</p>

<ol><li>The word &quot;Colportage&quot; is displayed on our tract (literature)
rack in the foyer.&nbsp; It reads, &quot;Moody <i>Colportage</i> Library.&quot;<br><br>
<li>The dried bat is located in the auditorium ceiling, in the center where
the beams meet, a few pews back from the front.<br><br>
<li>The first aid kit is located in the foyer on top of the mailboxes.&nbsp; Everyone should know this one!<br><br>
<li>The ramp is stored near the parking lot entranceway, inside the wooden
door just before the stairwell to the basement.&nbsp; There is a big sign posted
there.<br><br>
<li>We store boxes of Styrofoam cups in the basement, in the closet under the
stairs (across from the boiler room).<br><br>
<li>We have four telephones (not including cordless in our building, located
in the basement (kitchen hall), the foyer (by the drinking fountain), the
pastor's office (room 205) and the secretary's office (room 204).<br><br>
<li>Believe it or not, we have <b><u>eleven</u></b> levels in our church
facilities (not including landings on stairwells, but including rooms or areas
that are at least one step up).&nbsp; In the basement, we have the rest room
level, the fellowship hall level, and the stage (cave room).&nbsp; On the first
floor we have the entrance level, the foyer level (which is the auditorium
level), the platform, and the parlor level.&nbsp; Then we have the balcony
level, the second floor level, and the secretary's office level (up one step).&nbsp;
Add to that the third floor, and that makes eleven levels.&nbsp; This is why it
is impossible to install an elevator.<br><br>
