<p><sup>11</sup> When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him in his face, because
he was clearly in he wrong.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup> Before certain men came from James, he
used to eat with the Gentiles.&nbsp; But when they arrived, he began to draw back and
separate himself from the Gentiles because he was a afraid of those who belonged
to the circumcision group.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> The other Jews joined him in his
hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.</p>
