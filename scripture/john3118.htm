<p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> Now there was a man of the 
Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.
<sup>2</sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, 
&quot;Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could 
perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.&quot; 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> In reply Jesus declared, &quot;I tell 
you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.&quot;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> &quot;How can a man be born when he 
is old?&quot; Nicodemus asked. &quot;Surely he cannot enter a second time into his 
mother's womb to be born!&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Jesus answered, &quot;I tell you the 
truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the 
Spirit. <sup>6</sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, 
but the Spirit 
gives birth to spirit. <sup>7</sup> You should 
not be surprised at my saying, 'You 
must be born again.' <sup>8</sup> The wind blows 
wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from 
or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> &quot;How can this be?&quot; Nicodemus 
asked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> &quot;You are Israel's teacher,&quot; 
said Jesus, &quot;and do you not understand these things?
<sup>11</sup> I tell you the truth, we speak of 
what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not 
accept our testimony. <sup>12</sup> I have spoken 
to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I 
speak of heavenly things? <sup>13</sup> No one 
has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.
<sup>14</sup> Just as Moses lifted up the snake 
in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
<sup>15</sup> that everyone who believes in him 
may have eternal life.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> &quot;For God so loved the world 
that he gave his one and only Son, 
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
<sup>17</sup> For God did not send his Son into 
the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
<sup>18</sup> Whoever believes in him is not 
condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has 
not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.</p>
