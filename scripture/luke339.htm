<p><sup>3</sup> He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a
baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> As is written in
the book of words of Isaiah the prophet:</p>

<p>&quot;A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord,
make straight paths for him.&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> Every valley shall be filled in, every
mountain and hill made low.&nbsp; The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough
ways smooth.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> And all mankind will see God's salvation.'&quot;</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him,
&quot;You brood of vipers!&nbsp; Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?&nbsp;
<sup>8</sup>
Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.&nbsp; And do not begin to say to yourselves,
'We have Abraham as our father.'&nbsp; For I tell you that out of these stones God can
raise up children for Abraham.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> The ax is already at the root of the
trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and
thrown into the fire.&quot;</p>
