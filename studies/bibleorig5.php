<br>The Origin of the Bible, Part V: Manuscript Differences and Wrap-up
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Our church's constitution asserts what we (along with most 
evangelical and fundamental congregations) profess: &quot;We believe that the 
thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New 
Testament are verbally inspired by God and inerrant <b>in the original 
manuscripts</b>. Scripture is the only infallible source in determining matters 
of faith and practice.&quot;</p>
<p>By proclaiming that &quot;the original manuscripts&quot; are 
inspired, we fuel an obvious question: &quot;How close are our New Testament 
translations to the originally penned version of the New Testament?&quot; </p>
<p>The short answer is &quot;remarkably close.&quot; This is not to say 
that all the ancient manuscripts are in complete agreement without <i>any</i> 
variation at all. I am saying that the differences are generally minor and 
affect nothing we believe. </p>
<p>We have over 4,800 surviving ancient Greek manuscripts of 
the New Testament (the original language of the New Testament), 8,000 ancient 
Latin copies (translated from the Greek), and 1,000 ancient copies in other 
languages (also translated). </p>
<p>Using all available resources, scholars attempt to produce 
an extremely precise Greek New Testament -- a &quot;true-to-the-original master copy&quot; 
from which we can translate the New Testament into our language. These scholars 
look at the variations between manuscripts and apply logical principles to 
decide between variations. Principles of preference include: &quot;shorter endings 
are preferred to longer ones, more ancient manuscripts are given more weight 
than newer ones,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>But exactly how great are these variations? Scholars 
Geisler and Nix, in their classic book<i>, A General Introduction to the Bible</i>, 
write: &quot;Next to the New Testament, there are more extant manuscripts for the 
Iliad (643) than any other book....The New Testament has about 20,000 lines....The 
Iliad [has] about 15,600. Only 40 lines (or 400 words) of the New Testament are 
in doubt whereas 764 lines of the Iliad are questioned. This 5 percent textual 
corruption compares with one-half of 1 percent of similar emendations in the New 
Testament.&quot; In all but a few instances (mentioned below), we are talking about 
issues of very fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Since copies of the New Testament were spread throughout 
the ancient world, certain texts became localized. Thus variations would be 
multiplied and regionally different from manuscripts in other areas. But 
remember what Geisler and Nix pointed out: we are talking only about 400 words 
total, well less than one percent of the New Testament!</p>
<p>The basic manuscript families of texts are: Alexandrian, 
Caesarean, Western, and Byzantine. The Latin translations prevailed in Europe 
during the middle ages. When the Renaissance (and Reformation) hit Europe, an 
emphasis upon returning to original sources resulted. The Greek New Testament 
was now in vogue. The Greek manuscripts at hand in Europe were Byzantine 
manuscripts. These manuscripts were late copies (not very ancient). The King 
James New Testament was based on these manuscripts.</p>
<p>The other families of manuscripts were mostly unknown until 
the very early 20<sup>th</sup> century when they were discovered by 
archaeologists and scholars. One of them, a manuscript called <i>Codex Vaticanus</i> 
was found in the Vatican library! Another very important manuscript is called
<i>Codex Sinaiticus</i> (both from the fourth century); these two documents are 
the most influential New Testament sources and are 400 to 1,000 years older than 
the manuscripts used for the King James Version. </p>
<p>So how did we get these variations between the manuscripts? 
Because printing had not yet been invented, the manuscripts were copied by hand. 
And ancient people, like their modern counterparts, sometimes made mistakes! 
Many copyist errors involved misspelling a word or the addition or omission of a 
word like &quot;the.&quot; In later copies of the New Testament, it is likely that a 
teacher occasionally wrote an interpretative note on the margin of a manuscript. 
A future copyist may have thought such a note was actually part of the text to 
be inserted (thinking it had been inadvertently left out and then noticed 
later). He then inserts it. But the insertion would stand out because it would 
be unique to a certain region and not contained in manuscripts elsewhere. This 
is why John 5:4 appears only in <i>the King James Version</i> (which was based 
on <i>late</i> Byzantine Greek manuscripts) but the verse is not included in the 
NIV or NASB (based upon <i>early</i> manuscripts from diverse regions, 
manuscripts unknown to the <i>King James</i> translators).</p>
<p>When we eliminate spelling errors and other trivial 
differences, there are few notable differences between the most ancient and 
newer manuscripts (and the various families of documents). That is why almost 
all the differences between English translations are matters of English 
translation and not of source documents. Since English has a vocabulary many 
times greater than ancient Greek, translators must choose between a variety of 
English words. Translations are also based upon how English is spoken at the 
time of translation. So the differences between the New International Version 
and the King James Version are many times greater than the differences between 
the Greek manuscripts. </p>
<p>There are really only two major differences between 
manuscript families; these are found in the Gospels: (1) the longer and shorter 
ending of Mark, and (2) the story of the woman taken in adultery.</p>
<p>The more ancient copies of Mark's Gospel end chapter 16 
with verse 8, shortly after the resurrection of Christ. Verses 9-20 were not 
apparently in Mark's original version. Some have conjectured that the ending to 
Mark's original Gospel was lost, and that these verses were spliced in later 
from an unknown Gospel. Luke tells us that there were several Gospel accounts 
circulating in his day (Luke 1:1, <b>&quot;Many have undertaken to draw up an account</b> 
of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down 
to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word&quot;). 
So it is possible that the longer ending in Mark was taken from one of these 
other accounts. Since these other Gospels were probably very short and thus not 
useful, it could be that this longer ending was one of the few things unique in 
another Gospel (and so a scribe spliced it onto Mark's Gospel to replace Mark's 
lost ending). But note: this was done only in a region, and so the change is 
easily detected! Vaticanus and Sinaiticus, for example, do not contain Mark 
16:9-20. So we would want to be careful building doctrine on this passage, 
because it is uncertain.</p>
<p>The other major difference between manuscripts involves the 
account of the woman taken in adultery in John 8:1-11. The most ancient 
documents do not have this story included within the Gospel of John. 
Additionally, some manuscripts include this story after Luke 21:38, thus 
evidencing that this was an insertion. The reason for this insertion is probably 
the same as that above: one of the other early Gospels probably contained this 
story (and nothing else unique), so some scribe inserted it. These portions are 
not included <i>in Codex Vaticanus</i> or <i>Codex Sinaiticus</i>. This is not 
to say that this account is necessarily untrue (or uninspired). Rather, we are 
saying it was not originally part of John's Gospel. It therefore has the status 
of &quot;uncertain.&quot;</p>
<p>In both cases, there is a remote possibility that these 
accounts were original. Perhaps only one family of manuscripts (Byzantine) 
retained them. This is why we include them with a note. </p>
<p>These other Gospels to which Luke alludes are not the 
Gnostic Gospels <i>of The Da Vinci Code</i>, which were fabrications written by 
a group of cults much later. </p>
<p>Modern translations or good study Bibles note text 
variations so that you, the reader, can be aware of such differences. </p>
<p>In summary, the original manuscripts of the New Testament 
were inspired and without error. The Greek manuscripts are not without error, 
but a reliable 99% facsimile of the original manuscripts (the two Gospel issues 
mentioned above being possible exceptions).</p>
<p>The Bibles we read are inspired and inerrant to the degree 
that the manuscripts we have match the originals and to the degree that they are 
accurately translated. And they do exceptionally well on both counts.</p>
