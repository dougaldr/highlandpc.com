<p><sup>20</sup> Since you died with Christ to the basic 
principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit 
to its rules: <sup>21</sup> “Do not handle! Do not taste! Do 
not touch!”? <sup>22</sup> These are all destined to perish 
with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
<sup>23</sup> Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed
worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they
lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.</p>
