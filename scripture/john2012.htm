<p><sup>1</sup> Early on the first day of the week, while it 
was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been 
removed from the entrance. <sup>2</sup> So she came running to 
Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have 
taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!” </p>
