<p><sup>6</sup> We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among 
the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are

wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before 
time began. <sup>8</sup> None of the rulers of this age 
understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. </p>
