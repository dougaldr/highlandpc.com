<br>Compassion and Truth
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Great Father, I praise you. I praise the Son. I praise the Spirit.&nbsp;
Father, I
thank you for the relationship I have with you through the Son in the Spirit.&nbsp;
I
cannot claim to understand the mystery of your essence, but I trust the teaching
of your Word. I admit you are beyond my comprehension, but I know what your Word
says is true and perfect.</p>
<p>Father, soften my heart and keep it soft. So often I try to protect my heart
from pain and burden. So often I do not want to deal with my sin. So often I do
not want to alter my perspective to conform to your revealed will. So I harden
my heart. Help me to be willing to freely feel the pain that comes from
loving others who don't love in return. Help me face my sin. Help me conquer the
fear of change and thus conform to your will as revealed in your Word.</p>
<p>Lord, you are a God of compassion. Help me love others, assist me to feel
your compassion. Through trust in your sovereign hand, remind me again and again
that I cannot cure the ills of the world. Help me take the attitude of Jesus who
both extended himself to others while also reminding us that &quot;the poor you
will always have with you.&quot; Let me not be so overwhelmed by the task that I
am incapacitated. Instead, let me seek your leading and tackle the part of the
task that you have for me. If it be my lot to be a tiny cog in the great
machinery of your church, help me be a faithful and dependable cog.</p>
<p>Lord, I praise you that your Son has set me free by the truth. He is the way,
the life, and the truth. Help me to love truth in my inmost being. Help me speak
the truth. It is not enough for me merely to avoid lying, but I must also be
truthful. Help my tongue be an instrument of truth, truth stated kindly.&nbsp;
Yahweh,
preserve me from lying to myself. It is a constant battle to be true in my
inmost being. Be a Mighty Warrior and fight on my behalf. Show me how I am less
than truthful to myself and to others. Help me not only see, but help me correct
myself so that I may be a man of truth and integrity. May my &quot;yes&quot; be
&quot;yes&quot; and my &quot;no,&quot; &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Father, today I remember the Christian broadcasters around the world. Bless
those ministers of the truth who broadcast over short-wave radio, over local
AM/FM stations, and over television. May your Spirit hover over the radio waves
and bring conviction to the listeners.</p>
<p>Especially guide those who use artistic, musical, literary, and cultural
means to minister. May their creativity glorify you. Help them to recapture a
Christian influence in the world of the arts. May they, like Daniel, Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego distinguish themselves from those who know not the
Messiah. May they excel to such a degree that they not only gain respect as
equals but as masters to be emulated so that many hear the Gospel and respond in
faith.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me, Almighty One, never to lose the simplicity of my faith in you.&nbsp;
Help
me not to forsake spending daily time in the Word and in prayer. Help me find
and take opportunities to share Jesus with others. Use me to win others into the
Kingdom.</p>
<p>May all I do glorify you. In the name of the Savior, Amen.</p>
