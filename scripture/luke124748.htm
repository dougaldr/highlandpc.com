<p><sup>47</sup> That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready
or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. <sup>48</sup>
But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be
beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be
demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be
asked.</p>
