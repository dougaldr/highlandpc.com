<p>Lord,</p>
<p>You are the Most High God. You are not merely above us 
nor do You share Your status. You are truly above all; none are higher than 
You. No one outranks You; no one matches Your rank. You alone, Father, Son 
and Holy Spirit, are the Most High God. Although the evil one is powerful, he 
is far from at parity with You. As the hymnist put it, “one little word will 
fell him.” There is no competition. The difference between a single cell 
creature and a mortal man is great, but the difference between You, O Lord, and 
any created being is greater! Indeed, how can anyone who is finite be compared 
with You Who are infinite!</p>
<p>Father, as a sinful human being, I sometimes need to 
apologize to others. Help me not excuse my wrongs, or predicate my apologies 
based upon how others wronged me. Help me to ask for forgiveness by taking full 
responsibility for my actions and isolating them from the behavior of others. 
Help me utter those words, “I was wrong; please forgive me.”</p>
<p>Lord, I know that I have not because I ask not. Please, 
Lord meet the following needs and requests according to Your perfect will: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, troubled marriages are all around me. Often I am not 
aware of that. A friend at work, a neighbor, a relative. A mom with young 
children feels trapped and the couple could use some time away with her husband, 
but no family is near or there are no trusted friends to watch the children; 
finances are tight and the tensions high. A man or woman was reared in a messed 
up family and the baggage they bring into their marriage is destroying it. 
Long work hours, addictions, anger, violence and immorality—people all around 
us are struggling. Help us to be supportive in every way and help the 
marriages around me to get stronger especially within my church family.</p>
<p>I pray for the nation of the Ivory Coast. Once considered 
a safe base for missions, the Ivory Coast has become more turbulent. Lord, 
grant stability and continued religious freedom in this land. Help the 
Christians there to take charge of the church, to be strong and to multiply the 
number of believers in that land. Use the trauma of war and disunity to drive 
people to You and as things settle down may the church be more mature and 
stronger than ever.</p>
<p>I pray for World Relief, an organization that “works with 
local evangelical churches to bring relief to suffering people in the name of 
Christ. Together, World Relief and partner churches are saving lives and 
restoring hope through ministries that address poverty, disease, hunger, 
persecution and the effects of war and disasters.” Thank You that they seek to 
“meet suffering people's physical, emotional and spiritual needs—showing them 
that the Church cares because Jesus loves them.” O, God, provide for this 
ministry. Give them what they need to get the job done, the wisdom to do the 
job and the power of the Holy Spirit to bear fruit. Help them get along with 
one another and bless this work, I ask.</p>
<p>Now, Lord, help me be active for You today, I ask in 
Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
