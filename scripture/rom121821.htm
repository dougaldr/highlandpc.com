<p><sup>18</sup> If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace
with everyone.&nbsp; <sup>19</sup> Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for
God's wrath, for it is written: &quot;It is mine to avenge; I will repay,&quot;
says the Lord.&nbsp; <sup>20</sup> On the contrary: &quot;If your enemy is hungry,
feed him; If he is thirsty, give him something to drink.&nbsp; In doing this, you will
heap burning coals on his head.&quot; </p>

<p><sup>21</sup> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. </p>
