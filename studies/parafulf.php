<br>Parameter Fulfillment: A Newly-Defined Interpretational Principle
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

	<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
	<p>This is a preliminary study in Sacred Logic, a theme that should be, in 
	my opinion, a subcategory of Biblical Hermeneutics. In a sense, this paper 
	is launching such a theme with a clearcut example of how Sacred Logic 
	differs from Western Logic. Although I believe in absolute, objective truth, 
	the thought processes we see in Scripture presents and elaborates that truth 
	in a way that differs (slightly) from common western logic. If such is the 
	case, and if the Bible is the God-breathed, inspired, and inerrant Word of 
	the Lord, then its logic must, of necessity, be Divine (thus Sacred) Logic. 
	</p>
	<p>But how can truth be objective and absolute and yet not conform to standard 
	Western Logic? The only answer is that Western Logic is not in complete 
	harmony with the mind of God, a concept that should not surprise anyone who 
	reads Scripture. 
	<p>Let me illustrate how objective truth can exist within two logic systems. I 
	have a Macintosh computer in my office and a Windows PC in my home. Yet I 
	share and edit files between them. If we think of the text as truth and the 
	two operating systems as organizers of truth (systems of logic), we have a 
	perfect illustration. The two operating systems are not exactly the same, 
	but they display the same text. Like truth, the text stays the same. But the 
	computers have differing processes when it comes time to display that 
	information. Hence one job of the interpreter is to translate between the 
	two logical systems. 
	<p>We can determine the principles of Sacred Logic by careful, patient, and 
	prayerful observation. Then, once we have developed our hypothesis, we must 
	test it with Scripture time and time again to see if our theory passes the 
	test. 
	<p>This paper is about an obvious principle of Divine Logic. The principle is 
	crucial, for it unlocks many passages and sorts out a number of supposed 
	contradictions in Scripture. It brings freedom, clarity, and harmony to the 
	objective interpreter. 
	<p><b>Parameter Fulfillment </b>
	<p>Parameter Fulfillment (abbreviated as PF) is a concept clearly evident in 
	Scripture, in my estimate. It is connected to the distinction between 
	correlation and cause. Let me roll out the principle boldly and clearly: If 
	the conditions (correlates) around a prophecy or promise are matched, the 
	promise will be realized in some way (but not necessarily completely 
	fulfilled). 
	<p><b>The Two Directions (Major Categories) of Parameter Fulfillment </b>
	<p>Parameter Fulfillment can take two directions. <b>(1) Practical 
	Possibility:</b> 
	the promise/prophecy will only be completely fulfilled when God causes it to 
	be completely fulfilled. If and when the parameters (or conditions) of the 
	promise are somehow met, the promise will be fulfilled in some way even if 
	not in the final, literal way. <b>(2) Impractical Idealism:</b> God may offer to 
	fulfill a promise completely when humans fulfill specific criteria, but it 
	may be realistically impossible for humans to actually fulfill that criteria 
	(though possible perhaps only on paper). A case in point would be the offer 
	of the Kingdom to first century Israel (even though it was in God's plan for 
	the nation to reject their Messiah) or the command by Jesus for His 
	followers to be perfect as the Father in heaven is perfect 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt548.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 5:48</a>).
	<p>These two directions (major categories) will be subcategorized later in this 
	paper. 
	<p><b>Correlation and Cause: Sacred Logic vs. Western Logic </b>
	<p>In modern western thinking, logicians are careful to distinguish between a 
	correlation and a cause. Two events may occur together, but that does not 
	necessarily mean that one event or condition causes the other. As a 
	Wikipedia article states it, &quot;the idea that correlation proves causation, 
	is a logical fallacy by which two events that occur together are claimed to 
	have a cause and effect relationship.&quot; During the winter I wear a heavy 
	coat. It sometimes snows in the winter but never in the summer. I never wear 
	my coat in the summer. This does not mean my coat brings on the snow. They 
	are correlated (associated together), but one does not cause the other.
	<p>But when we are dealing with Scripture, we seem to find this pattern: If man 
	can replicate the conditions (correlates) of the prophecy, the prophecy 
	could (in theory) be fulfilled in some way (or even fully). 
	<p>Although modern western logic distinguishes between correlation and cause, 
	sacred logic may or may not do so. As we shall see, the Scriptures do show 
	evidence of distinction between cause and correlation, but, in other 
	instances it seems, God honors correlations as well as causes. Humans are 
	therefore sometimes presented with the option of realizing the promise by 
	creating the correlations surrounding the promise/prophecy (whether actually 
	possible or not). 
	<p>Here is an example of correlation thinking (apart from Scripture). When we 
	are in heaven (redeemed in the fullest sense), we will be sinless. 
	Therefore, if we become sinless on earth, we will enter the Kingdom of God 
	because we match the condition of those in heaven. This, I believe, was 
	Jesus' logic with the rich, young ruler. 
	<p>We know we are sinners and such will be our lot until we indeed are in 
	heaven, and we know that salvation is by grace, not works 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph289.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). 
	An offer like that above will never be realized. It might be offered, but it 
	will not be actualized. 
	<p>Let me demonstrate how Biblical examples deductively confirm the theory of 
	Parameter Fulfillment. The Bible provides us with a generous number of 
	examples, so we will peruse but a few. 
	<p><b>All Israel Will Be Saved </b>
	<p><b>Zechariah 12-13</b> (see especially 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/zech1210.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Zechariah 12:10</a> 
	and 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/zech1389.htm')" target=_self class=pop>13:8-9</a>) 
	tells us that at the end of the Tribulation (Armageddon), all surviving Israel 
	will believe and be converted. Paul chimes in and says, &quot;And so all Israel 
	will be saved&quot; (<b>Romans 11:26a</b>), meaning, in my opinion, all Israel as it exists just before 
	Christ returns to reign. <b>Second Peter</b> tells us that we can hasten the Day of the 
	Lord (<b>3:12</b> reads, &quot;as you look forward to the day of God and speed its 
	coming&quot;). What Peter is apparently saying is that as we evangelize (the 
	Jewish people in particular and others as well), we could theoretically meet 
	the conditions of Zechariah (when all Israel believes) and thus hurry the 
	Millennium. 
	<p>The Rabbis (as seen in the Talmud) expressed this same correlation belief. 
	Rather than believing that the Messiah would come in the fullness of time 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/gal44.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Galatians 4:4</a>), 
	according to God's plan, they believed that creating 
	Messianic conditions would bring the Messiah. We will see later that Peter 
	apparently embraced the same idea. 
	<p>R. Johanan also said: 
	<blockquote>The son of David will come only in a generation that is either 
		altogether righteous or altogether wicked. in a generation that is 
		altogether righteous, as it is written, Thy people also shall be all 
		righteous: they shall inherit the land for ever. Or altogether wicked, 
		as it is written, And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that 
		there was no intercessor, and it is [elsewhere] written, For mine own 
		sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it.</blockquote>
	<p>R. Alexandri said:
	<blockquote> R. Joshua b. Levi pointed out a contradiction. it is 
	written, in its time [will the Messiah come], whilst it is also written, I 
	[the Lord] will hasten it. if they are worthy, I will hasten it: if not, [he 
	will come] at the due time. R. Alexandri said: R. Joshua opposed two verses: 
	it is written, And behold, one like the son of man came with the clouds of 
	heaven whilst [elsewhere] it is written, [behold, thy king cometh unto thee 
	lowly, and riding upon an ass. if they are meritorious, [he will come] with 
	the clouds of heaven, if not, lowly and riding upon an ass. King Shapur [I] 
	said to Samuel, Ye maintain that the Messiah will come upon an ass: I will 
	rather send him a white horse of mine. (Babylonian Talmud: Tractate 
	Sanhedrin Folio 98a)</blockquote>
	<p>There is, obviously, a great distinction between what Peter wrote as 
	inspired, authoritative, inerrant Scripture and what the rabbis and sages 
	wrote (mere opinion). Still, let me call attention to the convergence of 
	mental framework. Both Peter and the sages are teaching that if we can 
	successfully reproduce kingdom conditions, the kingdom will come. If we 
	could bring about the Utopian conditions of Christ's reign, Christ would, in 
	effect, be reigning. 
	<p>We could see how the PostMillennial viewpoint espoused by optimistic 
	Christians in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century confused correlation with cause. The 
	Scriptures are clear (in my opinion) that Christ will return in the midst of 
	the Battle of Armageddon, the bloodiest war of all times. But I would give 
	the PostMillennialists this much credit: if we did create Millennial 
	conditions, God might honor that by establishing His rule on earth. But that 
	&quot;if&quot; is not even a possibility. It simply will not happen that way. 
	Nonetheless, the potential is there in theory.
	<p><b>The Offer of the Kingdom to the Jews by Peter</b><p><b>Acts 3:19-21</b> 
	has to be one of the most important (and neglected) texts of 
	Biblical Hermeneutics. Many Christians would claim they never heard or read 
	such verses. But I did not invent them. Peter is preaching to the Jews, when 
	he proclaims, &quot;Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that 
	times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Christ, 
	who has been appointed for you--even Jesus. He must remain in heaven until 
	the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago 
	through his holy prophets.&quot; 
	<p>Although not all readers will agree that this is obviously a promise of the 
	Millennial Reign of Christ, to me it seems evident. It appears that this 
	verse is making an offer to the children of Israel: If enough of you repent 
	and turn to Jesus, He will return and set up His Kingdom on the earth. 
	Again, as per the <b>Zechariah</b>/<b>Romans</b> example above, the return of Christ is 
	connected to meeting the parameters of a believing Israel. 
	<p><b>The Sermon on the Mount and the Offer to Israel</b><p>Although much of 
	the Sermon on the Mount is an exposition and application (Midrash) 
	of Torah to issues in first century Israel, part of the Sermon on the Mount 
	is about meeting parameters, in my estimate.
	<p>If the nation of Israel would reproduce the spiritual conditions of the 
	Kingdom by repenting and receiving the promised Messiah, then the Millennial 
	reign of Christ would soon be at hand. This certainly was not in the 
	Sovereign plan of God, and so it could not have happened otherwise. But 
	still, the correlation principle stands: if the people would have received 
	Jesus and His message, then God would have brought in the Millennium. 
	<p>Yet the people would not and could not meet those conditions (indeed, God 
	even hardened their hearts, according to 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john1240.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 12:40</a>). 
	The Kingdom of God was 
	truly at hand--potentially and theoretically. And, in a sense, the Kingdom 
	of God has in fact been realized in some form because some people did repent 
	and believe and thus partially met the parameters. Yet its full form is yet 
	future when the parameters of the Kingdom are met fully because God Himself 
	will make it so. Man, of his own accord, could never meet those parameters.
	<p>Some might argue that God only knows what is (a.k.a. &quot;Open Theism&quot;), not what 
	might have been (in theory). But this position is difficult to maintain in 
	light of <b>1 Samuel 23:10-13</b>:
	<blockquote>David said, &quot;O L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that 
	Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me. Will the 
	citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant 
	has heard? O L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, God of Israel, tell your servant.&quot; And the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said, 
		&quot;He 
	will.&quot; Again David asked, &quot;Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men 
	to Saul?&quot; And the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said, &quot;They will.&quot; So David and his men, about six 
	hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When 
	Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.&quot;</blockquote>
	<p>God made and makes offers knowing that they will be rejected. He knows what 
	will be and what could have been.
	<p><b>Elijah and Jehoash</b><p>As is already obvious, this correlation principle frequently involves the 
	paradox between the Sovereign will of God and human responsibility. We see a 
	prime case in <b>2 Kings 13:18ff</b> involving Elijah and Jehoash:
	<blockquote>Then he said, &quot;Take the arrows,&quot; and the king took them. Elisha told him, 
	&quot;Strike the ground.&quot; He struck it three times and stopped. The man of God was 
	angry with him and said, &quot;You should have struck the ground five or six 
	times, then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it. But 
	now you will defeat it only three times.&quot;</blockquote>
	<p>As we ponder this text, do we really believe that the king determined the 
	nature of his victory over Aram by how often he struck the ground? Or did 
	his behavior merely disclose what God had decreed? If you agree with me that 
	the latter is the case, you can see here how correlation is exchanged for 
	cause. Yet the text leaves us with no doubt that IF the king had struck the 
	staff five or six times, Aram would have been completely defeated. Yet, in 
	God's plan, the king could not have done so.
	<p><b>Jesus and the Doubting Baptist</b><p>Jesus seemed to fully embrace 
	the idea of Parameter Fulfillment when He 
	answered the doubt of John the Baptist. Note <b>Matthew 11:2-6</b> in light of the 
	Parameter Fulfillment theory: 
	<blockquote><p>When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples to 
	ask him, &quot;Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?&quot;
	<p>Jesus replied, &quot;Go back and report to John what you hear and see: The blind 
	receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf 
	hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor. 
	Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me.&quot;</blockquote> 
	<p>Note how, in a sense, Jesus brought in a form of the Kingdom (but not the 
	Millennium for which we are still waiting) because Jesus met the parameters 
	of the Kingdom Messiah. The literal Millennium will break forth in the 
	future, but there is a sense in which God honored the parameters met by 
	Jesus, thus God initiated the current Mystery form of the Kingdom. This was 
	according to plan, but not clearly revealed plan. 
	<p><b>Baptism and/or Good Works: The Cause of Salvation or Its Correlation?</b>
	<p>Since baptism is associated with salvation and/or repentance, it is 
	sometimes used in place of the invisible concepts of repentance and 
	conversion because it is correlated. Converts almost always showed their 
	spirit of repentance by submitting to baptism in the New Testament. 
	<p>The correlation between baptism and salvation has been misunderstood 
	throughout the centuries by Catholics and Campbellites alike. Because modern 
	western logic thinks in terms of cause and effect--and not correlation, 
	there seems to be two separate tracks in our minds. One track seems to 
	suggest that salvation is totally by God's grace through faith alone. 
	Another track seems to imply that man and God work together and that human 
	effort is required for one to be saved (monergism vs. synergism).
	<p>This seeming contradiction is cleared up when we understand Parameter 
	Fulfillment. Baptism (in the NT only) and good works (in both testaments) 
	are associated with salvation. In my view, monergism is the actual cause of 
	salvation, while synergism is the seeming correlation.
	<p>Take Jesus' words in <b>John 5:28-29</b>: &quot;Do not be amazed at this, 
	for a time is coming when all who are in their 
	graves will hear his voice and come out--those who have done good will 
	rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.&quot; 
	<p>A casual reader might conclude that this teaches salvation by works. Indeed, 
	the average man on the street believes in this Christless salvation. If your 
	good deeds outweigh your bad ones, you will inherit eternal life.
	<p>But when we understand Parameter Fulfillment, we recognize that association 
	(or correlation) is not the same as cause, though the Scriptural authors 
	often do not make this clear to the western reader. 
	<p>The fact is that sinful men cannot do good in God's eyes 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/rom88.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 8:8</a>) 
	and only those who are spiritually alive (regenerate) will have a place in the 
	Kingdom of God 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john3116.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 3:1-16</a>). 
	But good works are correlated with saving faith, even though the works do not 
	contribute to our salvation 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph2810.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Ephesians 2:8-10</a>). 
	Good works are the evidence (or result) of salvation. 
	<p>Thus we can measure the reality of one's salvation by good works and the 
	genuineness of faith by good works 
	(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/james21719.htm')" target=_self class=pop>James 2:17-19</a>). 
	Like a reading on a thermometer, the thermometer does not cause the temperature, 
	it merely indicates it. 
	<p>Yet the Biblical authors frequently do not distinguish between cause and 
	correlation. It is not that they were incapable of doing so, for they do at 
	times. 
	<p>One passage is particularly interesting. In midthought, the apostle Peter 
	begins presenting correlation in a way that could be understood as cause. 
	But he decides to clarify himself so that correlation and cause are made 
	distinct.
	<p>We read in <b>1 Peter 3:21</b>: &quot;and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves 
	you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good 
	conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&quot; 
	<p>Here, Peter is beginning to say that baptism saves us, but baptism is really 
	the correlation to salvation. It is actually the internal change within that 
	saves us, a repentance that is grounded to faith in the Gospel (partly 
	suggested by reference to the <nobr>resurrection).</nobr>
	<p>The simple truth about salvation is this: one must be regenerate (<i>born 
	again</i>) in order to be saved. This is true in both testaments (hence Jesus 
	expected Nicodemus to understand this, <u><i>as an Old Testament scholar</i></u>). Those 
	who are regenerate will show their new life by obedience and good works 
	which, depending upon one's understanding, may or may not include immersion. 
	<i>But regeneration is the cause and its correlates (associated behaviors) 
	include baptism, good works, confessing Christ as Lord, and faithfulness.
	</i>
	<p>This concept is similar to what Bullinger calls, Metonymy of the Effect or 
	Metonymy of Cause where cause is replaced by effect or effect cause (see E. 
	W. Bullinger, Figures of Speech Used in the Bible, Baker, 1981 printing, pp. 
	538ff).
	<p><b>The Second Coming of Christ and the Mount of Transfiguration</b>
	<p>In <b>Matthew 16:27-28</b> we read: &quot;For the Son of Man will come 
	in the glory of His Father with His angels, 
	and then He will reward each according to his works. Assuredly, I say to 
	you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see 
	the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.&quot; 
	<p>In 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt1719.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 17</a>, 
	the Gospel sequentially records the Mount of Transfiguration 
	event, a brief visit into the Millennial Kingdom Age. 
	<p>Please note that Peter interprets this event as the coming of Christ, a 
	near, less literal fulfillment. Note <b>2 Peter 1:16-18</b>: 
	<blockquote>For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you 
		<i><b>the 
	power and coming</b></i> of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His 
	majesty. For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an 
	utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, &quot;This is My beloved 
	Son with whom I am well pleased&quot; and we ourselves heard this utterance made 
		from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.</blockquote> 
	<p>Although admittedly open to more than one interpretation, <i>it seems Peter is 
	referring to the Second Coming of Christ when he says, &quot;power and coming,&quot;</i> 
	especially since Christ came the first time gently and humbly, but will come 
	in power at His Second Coming. 
	<p><i>In my opinion, Peter is saying that, in some way, He witnessed the Second 
	Coming</i> of Christ on the Mount of Transfiguration. 
	<p>Clearly the New Testament leaves us awaiting the literal Kingdom Age, the 
	millennial coming of Christ, and a distant, more literal reign of Christ. 
	Yet the parameters of the Millennium were met when Jesus was glorified and 
	communing with Moses and Elijah. This is a prime example of what I mean by 
	Parameter Fulfillment. 
	<p>As I stated earlier, If the conditions (correlates) around a prophecy or 
	promise are matched, the promise will be realized <i>in some way</i> (but not 
	necessarily completely fulfilled). In the case of the Transfiguration, since 
	the parameters were met, the Kingdom, in a sense, was here. 
	<p><b>John the Baptist and Elijah</b><p>In <b>Matthew 11:14</b>, Jesus 
	describes John the Baptist: &quot;And if you are willing 
	to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.&quot; 
	<p>Speaking of himself in <b>John 1:21a</b>, John denies that he is Elijah, &quot;They 
	asked him, 'Then who are you? Are you Elijah?' He said, 'I am not.'&quot;
	<p>In <b>Luke 1:17a</b>, the angel states to John's father, Zechariah, &quot;And he will go 
	on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah.&quot; 
	<p>The implication seems obvious, John was an Elijah substitute; he could meet 
	the parameter of the return of Elijah in <b>Malachi 4:5</b>, &quot;See, I will send 
	you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> 
	comes.&quot; Yet God did not plan for Israel to receive the Messiah at His first 
	coming. 
	<p>So John met the Elijah parameter in some way, but Elijah will literally 
	return before the Millennium (possibly one of the two witnesses of 
	Revelation). 
	<p><b>Subcategorization of Parameter Fulfillment </b>
	<p>Since this is a very tentative and postulating paper, let me begin listing 
	several areas in which Parameter Fulfillment (PF) comes into play: 
	<ol type=1><li><p><b>Practical Possibility</b> 
	<ol type=A><li><p><b>Prophecies</b> (including double fulfillment) 
	<p>The Second Coming of Christ and the Mount of Transfiguration are cases in 
	point. So is the Virgin Birth prophecy of 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/is714.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Isaiah 7:14</a>. 
	<li><p><b>Unconditional Promises/Certainties</b> (guaranteed to be met) 
	<p>If you believe in the doctrine of perseverance (eternal security), you can 
	see how the admonitions to remain faithful and endure to the end are 
	correlated with the idea that we are safe and secure and cannot lose our 
	salvation since we are kept by the power of God. Our faithfulness is 
	correlated with our security, but does not necessarily cause our security. 
	<p>We can also see how Jesus could be God in the flesh and yet tempted to sin. 
	Since temptation is correlated to sin but does not cause sin, Jesus could be 
	tempted to sin but never made to sin. 
	<li><p><b>Theoretically Conditional Promises</b> (the conditions of which could 
	somewhat be met)<p>The New Covenant fits perfectly into this category and the category above at 
	the same time. Since the Messiah established the New Covenant with His 
	followers (those Who did receive Him, according to 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john112.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 1:12</a>), 
	we are New Covenant believers. 
	<p>Yet, God will see to it that all Israel will believe near the end times, for 
	according to 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/jer313134.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, 
	the New Covenant is a sovereign act God performs 
	upon the nation of Israel, regenerating them all. </ol>
	<li><p><b>Impractical Idealism 
	</b> 
	<p><b>Theoretical Conditional Promises</b> (the conditions of which could or would 
	never be met)<p>The rich young ruler (salvation by keeping commandments) 
	<p><b>Acts 3:19-21</b>, as pointed out above is fascinating. Here, Peter is telling 
	the Jews that if the nation would get its spiritual house in order by 
	repenting and embracing Jesus as the Messiah, the Kingdom (Millennium) would 
	be established shortly after these conditions were met. </ol>
	<p><b>Correlation treated as cause</b><p>Scripture is replete with examples of PF 
	and the exchange of correlation for 
	cause. Sometimes an associated circumstance (correlate) is used as the cause 
	itself. A casual reader of <b>Genesis</b> will conclude that God destroyed Sodom 
	and Gomorrah because of sexual perversion (<b>Genesis 18-19 <i>passim</i></b>), yet Ezekiel 
	states this in <b>Ezekiel 16:49-50</b>: &quot;Now this was the sin of your 
	sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned, 
	they did not help the poor and needy. They were haughty and did detestable 
	things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen.&quot; 
	<p>Here, secondary or extenuating causes are replaced for primary causes. The 
	sense one gets from reading <b>Genesis 18-19 <i>passim</i></b> (perversion) is the clear reason 
	God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. But Ezekiel hones in on other sins, that, 
	by themselves, would probably not have resulted in Sodom's demise. They 
	simply accompanied the practice of Sodomy. 
	<p>We see something similar in <b>Jonah 4:11</b>, where God is defending His desire to 
	show mercy to Nineveh, &quot;But Nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty 
	thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and many 
	cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?&quot; 
	<p>Reading such a verse, one has to ask how large a part Nineveh's cattle 
	played in God's decision to be merciful. The primary cause of God's desire 
	to have mercy upon Nineveh was His concern for the people of Nineveh. The 
	cattle went along with the deal--a correlation. 
	<p><b>Conclusion </b>
	<p>Parameter Fulfillment, by acknowledging a logical system that does not 
	always distinguish correlation from cause, is a tool for the Biblical 
	interpreter to enter into the thinking of the human authors of the Bible and 
	our gracious God Who inspired the written Word of God. 
	<p>It is somewhat different from the way we think, but the pattern is clear in 
	Scripture. If we simply apply the pattern we do find in the Bible to 
	interpreting the Bible, we will find that we can more easily harmonize 
	passages that seemed to defy harmonization. 
	<p>Lord willing, coming down the road...Parameter Fulfillment applied to the 
	paradox of God's Sovereignty and man's freewill, the New Covenant, and more!
