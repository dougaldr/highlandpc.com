<p><sup>5:22</sup> Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.&nbsp; <sup>23</sup>
For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his
body, of which he is the Savior.&nbsp; <sup>24</sup> Now as the church submits to
Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and
gave himself up for her <sup>26</sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the
washing with water through the word, <sup>27</sup> and to present her to himself
as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but&nbsp;
holy and blameless.&nbsp; <sup>28</sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their
wives as their own bodies.&nbsp; He who loves his wife loves himself.&nbsp; <sup>29</sup>
After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just
as Christ does the church&#151; <sup>30</sup> for we are members of his body.&nbsp; <sup>31</sup>
&quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to
his wife, and the two will become one flesh.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>32</sup> This is a
profound mystery&#151;but I am talking about Christ and the church.&nbsp; <sup>33</sup>
However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the
wife must respect her husband.</p>

<p><sup>6:1</sup> Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&nbsp;
<sup>2</sup>
&quot;Honor your father and mother&quot;&#151;with a promise&#151; <sup>3</sup>
&quot;that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on
earth.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up
in the training and instruction of the Lord.</p>
