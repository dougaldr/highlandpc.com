<p><sup>1</sup> Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I 
preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your 
stand. <sup>2</sup> By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly 
to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> For what I received I passed on to you as of first 
importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</p>
