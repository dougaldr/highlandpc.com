<p><sup>23</sup> Then Abraham approached him and said: &quot;Will you 
sweep away the righteous with the wicked? <sup>24</sup> What if 
there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and 
not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? <sup>25</sup> 
Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the 
wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will 
not the Judge of all the earth do right?&quot; </p>
<p><sup>26</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> said, &quot;If I find fifty righteous 
people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>27</sup> Then Abraham spoke up again: &quot;Now that I 
have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and 
ashes, <sup>28</sup> what if the number of the righteous is five 
less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;If I find forty-five there,&quot; he said, &quot;I will not destroy it.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>29</sup> Once again he spoke to him, &quot;What if only 
forty are found there?&quot; </p>
<p>He said, &quot;For the sake of forty, I will not do it.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>30</sup> Then he said, &quot;May the Lord not be angry, 
but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?&quot; </p>
<p>He answered, &quot;I will not do it if I find thirty there.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>31</sup> Abraham said, &quot;Now that I have been so bold 
as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?&quot; </p>
<p>He said, &quot;For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>32</sup> Then he said, &quot;May the Lord not be angry, 
but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?&quot; </p>
<p>He answered, &quot;For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.&quot; </p>
