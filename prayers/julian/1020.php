<p>My Master,</p>
<p>Your arm is a mighty arm indeed! Not that You have a 
physical arm with biceps and triceps. The Biblical term, “Your arm” refers to 
Your mighty power against which none can even hope to stand.</p>
<p>When You roll up Your sleeves to accomplish something, 
Your arm is determined to accomplish Your purpose. Your arm represents Your 
power to destroy, defeat, or accomplish. Because of Your mighty arm, You can 
deliver Your children. Your arm’s power is a miraculous power. The power of 
the universe combined is negligible compared to Your mighty arm.</p>
<p>Thank You that You have chosen to reveal to me one of the 
most powerful things accomplished by Your mighty arm: my redemption of sin 
through the sacrifice of the Messiah. Your mighty arm has not been revealed to 
all, but it has been to me 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/is531.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Isaiah 53:1</a>).</p>
<p>Lord, You are not the God Who leaves us as spiritual 
orphans. When You regenerated us—caused us to be born again with the result 
that we are now saved—You also gave us Your Spirit! You are the God Who is 
out to finish what He started. Thank You that You are leading us toward 
spiritual maturity.</p>
<p>Lord, help me not to be a sensitive, touchy person. Neither allow me to have 
a hard heart. Instead help me to evaluate corrections and sincere criticism 
without punishing those who expose my weak points. Help me to be teachable not 
touchy; eager to grow, not defensive.</p>
<p>Today I remember families who are struggling, perhaps even my own. Lord, it is 
sometimes hard to get along. Sometimes some family members may not want to do 
Your will; at other times we may disagree as to what that will is. Please, Lord, 
bring peace and harmony to my family and the families of my friends at church, 
other friends and relatives. Help our homes become places of refuge not hotbeds 
of stress.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for what You have done in the nation of 
Venezuela. Although recent politics threaten freedom, You have been working 
mightily in this nation of over 25 million people! Thank You that over 10 percent 
of the population identify themselves as evangelical Christians. Thank You for 
working mightily in this land. I pray that the Gospel would 
spread like wildfire and that the percentage of believers would double over 
this next decade. Help the church to grow in depth as well, I ask. Protect Your 
children, I pray.</p>
<p>O Lord, bless Reciprocal Ministries International which &quot;is a 
ministry dedicated to spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ through establishing, 
developing and promoting all aspects of church ministry and missionary activity 
in the Third World. RMI is the layperson's mission. Its sister church program 
links churches cross-culturally and helps build relationships that are 
reciprocal, intimate, in-depth, ongoing, practical and spiritual.&quot; O Father, 
bless and use this work to nurture believers and spread Your Kingdom, I ask.</p>
<p>I pray for those who work as heating, air conditioning and 
refrigeration mechanics and installers. Keep them safe, help them do quality 
work and to treat clients well. Provide for them and may those who know You 
freely share their faith by both word and deed, I ask.</p>
<p>Help me bring the joy of Jesus to others today, I pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
