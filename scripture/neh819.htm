<p><sup>1</sup> All the people assembled as one man in the square before the
Water Gate. They told Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses,
which the L<span>ORD</span> had commanded for Israel.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought
the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were
able to understand. <sup>3</sup> He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he
faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and
others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book
of the Law.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the
occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah,
Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum,
Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he
was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up. <sup>6</sup>
Ezra praised the L<span>ORD</span>, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and
responded, &quot;Amen! Amen!&quot; Then they bowed down and worshiped the L<span>ORD</span>
with their faces to the ground.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> The Levites-Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,
Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah-instructed the
people in the Law while the people were standing there. <sup>8</sup> They read
from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that
the people could understand what was being read.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the
Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, &quot;This day is
sacred to the L<span>ORD</span> your God. Do not mourn or weep.&quot; For all the people had
been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.</p>
