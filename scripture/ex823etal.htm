<p><sup>8:23</sup> I will make a distinction between my people and your people. 
This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.</p>
<p><sup>9:4</sup> But the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> will make a distinction 
between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging 
to the Israelites will die.</p>
<p><sup>9:6</sup> And the next day the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> did it: All 
the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the 
Israelites died.</p>
<p><sup>9:26</sup> The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where 
the Israelites were</p>
<p><sup>10:23</sup> No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three 
days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.</p>
<p><sup>11:7</sup> &quot;But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man 
or animal.&quot; Then you will know that the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> makes a 
distinction between Egypt and Israel.</p>
