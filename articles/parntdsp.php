<br>Parenting and the Discipline Continuum
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>September makes us think of school, school of kids, and kids of parenting.&nbsp;
What a big subject that is!&nbsp; How we rear our children is a highly personal
matter integrating our individual tastes, personalities, and philosophies of
life.&nbsp; This leads us in different directions, even within the Bible
believing community.&nbsp; One controversial area is the matter of discipline
(including levels of firmness).&nbsp; The Bible encourages us to rear our
children in the &quot;discipline and nurture of the Lord.&quot; (<b>Ephesians
6:4</b>, NASB).</p>

<p>There are many verses in Scripture about discipline in the sense of
punishment for wrong, the most famous of which is <b> Proverbs 13:24</b>, &quot;He who
spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline
him.&quot; &nbsp;But child rearing is much more involved than mere instances of
correction.&nbsp; Proper child rearing is about direction and offering security
through firmness.&nbsp; It is about teaching respect for authority without
stifling and frustrating a child.&nbsp; Just as the latter part of <b> Ephesians 6:4</b> is
neglected by many parents, so the first portion of the verse is neglected by
perhaps as many, &quot;Parents, do not exasperate your children.&quot;&nbsp; Parents who are too permissive produce brat-like children who are crying out for
(but not receiving) boundaries.&nbsp; Parents who are too strict produce
excessively quiet, frustrated, internalizing, and non-social children.&nbsp;
Both extremes keep the psychiatrist's couch full.</p>

<p>Here is Vasicek advice on child rearing.&nbsp; It is far from infallible and
not suited for all situations, but neither is it extreme or unusual.&nbsp; It is
NOT one size fits all, but I would like to suggest it as a starting point for
typical situations.&nbsp; Some special needs children, for example, do not
connect the &quot;cause and effect&quot; concept; it seems improper to hold them
accountable for that which they cannot control.&nbsp; So my advice applies to
typical situations only.</p>

<p>First of all parents, not children, need to lead the household.&nbsp; This
changes a bit as the kids mature, but should always be the bottom line.&nbsp; Young
children (18 months to age 7) do not need to be given explanations as to why to
obey (other than it is right to do so), but should be taught to obey simply
because mom or dad say so.&nbsp; &quot;Why?&nbsp; Because I told you to and I am
your dad&quot; is plenty of reason.&nbsp; &quot;You don't have to want to put
away your toys, you just have to do it&quot; is another good line.&nbsp; This
approach lays a good foundation.&nbsp; If you try to direct your young children
on the basis of relationship, reason or &quot;niceness,&quot; you will be unable
to progressively give your children freedom as they age.&nbsp; Younger children
need to be told, not asked.&nbsp; If parents mess up here then the rest of the
course will be off center.&nbsp; Don't demand too much from your child (the
mistake parents who frustrate make), but make sure what you do demand is
followed through to completion.&nbsp; Let your kids enjoy being kids, let them
enjoy having fun.&nbsp; When they grow up, they'll have plenty of chores and
responsibilities.&nbsp; Everything does NOT need to have a serious or educational
purpose.&nbsp; Ten year olds do not need to worry about saving up for college.&nbsp;
Kids are supposed to have lots of fun.&nbsp; Let them.&nbsp; But make sure they
learn to obey.</p>

<p>Discipline children aggressively between the ages of 2 and 3.&nbsp; If you
spank or use a time out chair, do so ONLY for willful disobedience, not
accidents or general childish irresponsibility (e.g., kids have to be made to
clean up after their messes-supervise them and make it happen, do not tell them
to do it later and then get angry when they fudge out of it, etc.).&nbsp; Do not
punish too harshly, but fit the punishment to the infraction.&nbsp; Do not offer
a strict punishment and then fail to carry it out-think first.&nbsp; If
uncontrolled anger is a problem with you, or if you sense a tendency to be
abusive, let your mate do the disciplining; it is obviously better not to spank
at all than to abuse a child.&nbsp; (Note: if you have a problem this way, seek
professional help).</p>

<p>Even though in most instances I recommend spanking, one punishment that is
absolutely unwise for younger children is grounding.&nbsp; Whatever punishment
you use should be swift so that a lesson is learned.&nbsp; Grounded children
often forget why they were punished and parents suffer more than the kids do.&nbsp;
Grounding may be useful for teens, but not for younger kids.&nbsp; Additionally, you
should not have to shout at your kids.&nbsp; A shouting parent not only behaves
in a low-classed manner, but evidences failure in discipline.</p>

<p>I do not recommend equating their disobedience with sins against God (even
though such may be the case), but it is good to teach the general principle of
obedience as something God wants.&nbsp; Reasoning should be reserved for older
children, especially junior high kids and up. &nbsp;I cannot
emphasize how important it is to be firm (but not mean).&nbsp; You do no
one a service by letting your child manipulate you.&nbsp; KIDS CRAVE FIRM
(BUT REASONABLE) PARENTS.&nbsp; They may act otherwise, say things like,
&quot;You don't really love me&quot; or, &quot;I don't like you.&quot;&nbsp; Take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;
They want the security of firm but
reasonable boundaries (though they may claim your boundaries are unreasonable).&nbsp;
This is also true with teens, especially with setting an age for dating.</p>

<p>If you are firm with your young children, you can begin to loosen up as they
grow older.&nbsp; Parents who release too many decisions to their young
children have no more LEGITIMATE freedom to grant their teens.&nbsp; The only
new freedom left is the freedom to do wrong, a freedom none of us need.&nbsp; As
children age, parents should begin to explain the reason for prohibitions, etc.,
but not necessarily to the child's satisfaction.&nbsp; Compromising should
increase as children age. &nbsp;PARENTS DO GENERALLY KNOW MORE THAN THEIR KIDS
DO, THOUGH THE KIDS MAY NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH IS THE CASE.&nbsp; DO NOT LET YOUR
KIDS CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE.</p>

<p>As children grow into junior and senior high age, a transition begins to take
place.&nbsp; Whereas young children are to be controlled by 90% parental
authority and 10% choice or reason, tenth graders (roughly) approach the 50%
mark.&nbsp; By the time kids leave high school, they become the major decision
makers in matters regarding their lives; mom and dad still have a good deal of
influence, but that influence is based more upon relationship than authority.</p>

<p>As long as children live at home, they must abide by house rules.&nbsp; And
as long as children receive financial support from parents, they ought to agree
to some broad principles of conduct.&nbsp; When parents invest in their children
financially, with that investment comes a right to at least a degree of
influence (which is why it is not good for married couples to take money from
their parents).</p>

<p>In summary, good parenting begins with the unapologetic assertion of
authority and ends with influence based upon the relationship that was built (if
indeed it was).&nbsp; But remember, if you are not comfortable asserting your
authority with the little ones, your children will end up ruling your
household-and you will have no legitimate freedom to offer them as they age.&nbsp;
All
are losers when parents are not comfortable with their own authority.</p>
