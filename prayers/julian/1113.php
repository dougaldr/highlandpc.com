perceptive. You are keenly aware of all things, events, results and feelings. 
You grasp every situation and You discern even the thoughts, motives and 
intentions of our hearts completely. Indeed, all things are laid bare before 
You. There is no reality You do not understand, no problem that perplexes You 
and no situation that confuses You. You are God, the One who completely 
understands all that was, is, or shall be.';

<br>November 13

<p>O Lord,</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is my sin offering. I do not present my good works to You, for 
they are as filthy rags. I do not present religion or rituals to You. No, Jesus 
Christ is my final offering. He paid for my sins so I do not need to. Indeed, I 
cannot do so. As the hymnist put it, &quot;Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to Thy 
cross I cling.&quot; As my sin offering, Jesus Christ is my complete Savior. He does 
not help to save me. No, he saves me completely. His blood atones for all my 
sins. He shed it once for all time for all people including me. I have 
appropriated this sacrifice by simply believing, by faith. Faith affirms Your 
character and agrees that what You say is true. Disbelief rejects Your 
credibility and is a great insult to You. Lord, I believe.</p>
<p>Help me be a person of character. Let my &quot;yes&quot; really mean &quot;yes.&quot; Help me to 
speak honestly. Instead of saying what I should say, help me either speak my 
mind with tact or, if appropriate, hold my peace. But do not let my lips utter 
words I do not believe. Help me to love the truth.</p>
<p>Father, today I pray for the Bible-believing faithful pastors scattered in my 
country and around the world. Lord, their task is more difficult than ever. The 
modern challenges to the family, busier schedules, the high demands and 
expectations of church members and the stresses of ministry make pastoral work a 
high burnout calling. Additionally, troublemakers plague many churches and 
sometimes lay leaders with unhealthy attitudes control them. Pastors have to 
wear so many hats and be taught in so many areas: preaching, teaching, 
counseling, visiting, organization, keeping current on issues and ministry 
trends, administration, leadership, officiating weddings, funerals and 
baptisms...on and on it goes. Help pastors to stand up to attacks and not be 
passive, to pray and be alert and not try to make everyone happy. Help them do 
what is in the best interest of the church and the Kingdom of God. Help them 
train lay leaders to do the work of ministry and to put the ministry of the 
Word, their personal walk with You and their families above the expectations of 
others. Help them accept the reality that they will always have plenty of undone 
work, but help them not to be a slave to the &quot;tyranny of the urgent.&quot;</p>
<p>Today I pray for those who determine the missions’ policy in my home church. 
Lord, many churches are so into themselves that they do not put much emphasis on 
foreign missions. This is so contrary to Your Great Commission 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/matt281920.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 28:19-20</a>), 
the church's &quot;job description.&quot; It urges us to do our part to get 
the Gospel to the entire world. Our own nation and area will always have needs, 
but we must share Christ with those who have never heard. Please, Lord, deliver 
us from ethnocentrism and help us understand that You want us to reach people of 
every kindred, tribe and nation. Guide our church leaders so they recognize the 
importance of this task and help them seek to do a fair share of supporting 
missions.</p>
<p>Now, Lord, help me be a good witness for You today, I pray in Jesus’ Name, 
Amen.</p>
