<br>Controlling the Control Bug
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>
In a recent editorial for the Kokomo Tribune, in a series about &quot;social
connectedness,&quot; I mentioned what I call the &quot;anonymous
lifestyle.&quot; Here I
would like to use this concept as a jumping board for another issue: the
&quot;control obsession.&quot;
</p>

<p>
People often gravitate to an anonymous lifestyle, one in which they can melt
into the crowd, one in which the worker bees work, the Queen sits on the
eggs, and everything is regimented and orderly. Behind this quest for
specialty, organization, and planning, is the fear of revealing too much
about our humanity, a discomfort with being an imperfect, sinful, and
sometimes incompetent human. If we all show our strong side and hide the
rest, just think of what we can do.
</p>

<p>
The military has exploited this concept for decades. A soldier is no
longer
a human being from a family with ma and pa; he is a G.I., Government Issue,
a son of the republic. Communism capitalized this idea as well, even
removing children from their homes at age 2 for training, returning them to
parents for weekends only (as Cuba did during Castro's heyday). If we can
become a cog in the machinery, a gear in the transmission, or a washer
holding on a bolt, we somehow sense that humanity&#151;ours included&#151;is
either under control or at least hidden from view. We feel secure. But
camouflaging ourselves in the crowd is only one of many &quot;control&quot;
techniques.
</p>

<p>
Some of us fear our vulnerability so much that we will take infinite pains
to be in charge. Perfectionism is one of the most common expressions of the
control bug. Another method of control is an obsession to be in
leadership,
to give orders rather than take them, to have our way rather than
compromise. Of course, the type of leaders Jesus' endorses are
servant-leaders not power mongers. Legalism, in which every detail is
spelled out in advance, is yet another way we may try to maintain control;
we seek more rules, standards, and specifics that force ourselves and others
to toe the line. Bullheadedness is not just a trait; it is a control
strategy. Others gravitate toward anorexia or workaholism, numerous
addictions, or a competitive materialism. The list goes on and on.
</p>

<p>
We know that Lucifer's original sin
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/is141217.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Isaiah 14:12-17</a>) was craving to be in control
above God. He simply did not want God bossing him around. In his eyes, he
had every bit as much a right to be God as God did. Such insanity is the
end result of giving in completely to the &quot;control bug.&quot; &nbsp;An obsession with
control has driven many men and women over the edge of insanity.
</p>

<p>
Having briefly diagnosed the problem and highlighted a few of the negatives,
let me now set forth a few positive assertions about the control bug.
</p>

<ol>
  <li type=1>It is natural and right for us to desire a certain level of control.&nbsp;
    Few of us relish the possibility that one day we may be bound to a
wheelchair and cared for by strangers in a nursing home. We are all human
beings in the image of God and do not want to be taken advantage of or
abused by others. In moderation, a desire to be in control is healthy and
good.
<br>
  <li type=1>Rather than take the role of God, trying to be sovereign and find
domains where we can feel omnipotent, we must learn to be comfortable with
being under less-than-perfect leaders and laws. Sometimes we are the
victims of decisions made by others. We can learn to accept our
vulnerability, our fallen state, our fallibility, and our &quot;less than
God-ness.&quot;
<br>
  <li type=1>We can learn to accept our humanity and the humanity of others without
sterilizing it through highly specialized function. The doctor is not God,
but a man or woman as human as anyone. The soloist does not just have a
beautiful voice, but she can get angry at her husband and really let him
have it. The teacher procrastinates as much as your brother-in-law. Regimenting humanity through volume and specialty does not change human
nature. It only masks it.
</ol>

<p>
So if your desire to be in control is more than moderate, maybe you need to
learn to get comfortable with the human condition: yours and everyone
else's. Let God be God. It's tough enough to be a halfway godly
Christian.
</p>

<p>
But I need to add one further point. In our spiritual pilgrimage, there
are
times when God confronts us with our tendency to rule our own lives. He
challenges us to present our control bug to him. This is called
&quot;surrender.&quot; It is natural for us to want to control our lives,
our
decisions, and our direction. When we are surrendered to the Lord, we let
him make the choices. We turn over the reigns to him; we submit ourselves
to his Lordship. &nbsp;The surrendered life is not perfect because our surrender
is never complete nor permanent in this life. Parts of our lives or
personalities hold out.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of Italy, there is a little country called San Marino. In the
19th century, Italy was not a country, just a group of provinces that spoke
a similar language, much of it ruled by the Austrians. It was Garibaldi
who
is usually credited with uniting those provinces (or city-states) into the
modern nation of Italy. But San Marino, with a population less than that
of
Kokomo, never got on boards. So, too, we have hidden San Marinos in our
lives, holdout areas from the Lord. But if we surrender as much of our
lives as Garibaldi united Italy, we will be among the godliest people on
earth. Let God have the reigns of your life. Your house does not
need to
be immaculate; you don't have to be the best in your field. &nbsp;Instead, you
can own the best title one can have on earth, &quot;a servant of Jesus
Christ.&quot;
