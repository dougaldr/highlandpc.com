<p><sup>1</sup> Here is a trustworthy saying: If anyone sets his heart on being
an overseer, he desires a noble task.&nbsp; <sup>2</sup> Now the overseer must be
above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled,
respectable, hospitable, able to teach, <sup>3</sup> not given to drunkenness,
not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> He
must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper
respect.&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how
can he take care of God's church?)&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> He must not be a recent convert,
or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup>
He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall
into disgrace and into the devil's trap.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not
indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.&nbsp; <sup>9 </sup>They must
keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup>
They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them
serve as deacons.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> In the same way, their wives are to be women worthy of respect,
not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage
his children and his household well.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> Those who have served well
gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
