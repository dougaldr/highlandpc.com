<p>My gracious Master and my God,</p>
<p>You are a benevolent God. You are kind, generous and compassionate. Our Lord 
Jesus Christ is a high priest Who can sympathize with our weaknesses. Although 
You are a consuming fire, You are also tenderhearted, charitable and good. Even 
though we have sinned against You, You still love us and care about us and feel 
for us and provide for us.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that for me—and all Who know Christ—death has lost its 
sting. At death, my body and soul are separated. Although my soul will go to 
enjoy your presence, one day my resurrection body and soul will be reunited. But 
I will never face spiritual death, the separation of my soul from You. This is 
the second death experienced by those who do not know Christ. Jesus will say to 
them, &quot;Depart from me.... I never knew you.&quot; Thank You that Jesus knows me!</p>
<p>Great Father of Lights, I pray that You would enlighten those who are 
struggling with substance abuse and addictions. Some who name the Name of Christ 
find themselves captive to alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal drugs, 
pornography, or are rampant spenders of money. Give them grace and the courage 
to believe that life can be rich and meaningful without their addiction. Help 
them develop new habits and associations to replace the old ones and help them 
to focus on getting to know You more than anything else.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the nation of Ukraine with its 50 million 
people. Thank You that over 2.7% of the population claims to be born-again 
evangelicals and that the church has nearly doubled since the Soviet Union 
broke up. Although millions of Christians have died over the last 140 years 
(even before communism), thank You that the evangelical church is vibrant and 
strong. But the nation is poor and still recovering from Chernobyl. 
Leadership training is hard to come by. Lord, may the percentage of born-again 
evangelicals double over the next decade. Help the church to get stronger and 
stronger and the nation to become more prosperous. Use the Jesus Film and 
Christian media to reach many, I ask.</p>
<p>I remember parents. Lord, parents are so important to 
those little ones entrusted to their care. May parents everywhere protect and 
train their children in humane and balanced ways. Help them to love their 
children, not to spoil them and to encourage them toward positive directions. 
We pray that Christian parents would prove to be consistent role models for 
their young ones. Send angels to protect them, I pray.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for Men For Missions International in which &quot;thousands 
of men from various church affiliations and all walks of life find 
a channel for harnessing and releasing personal skills and abilities in 
practical, direct missionary involvement. By participation in overseas witness 
and work teams, they catch new zeal for soul winning at home as well as 
abroad.... As a result, scores of missionary homes, schools, churches, clinics, 
etc., stand as monuments to the obedience of individual laymen. Millions of 
dollars are given to support missionaries, national workers, and evangelistic 
outreach.&quot; O Lord, bless this dynamic ministry! Provide, protect, 
motivate, grant harmony and empower this ministry.</p>
<p>Empower me to 
serve You today, I pray in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
