<p><sup>1</sup> Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, 
&quot;Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth. <sup>2</sup> 
The fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the 
birds of the air, upon every creature that moves along the ground, and upon all 
the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands. <sup>3</sup> 
Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the 
green plants, I now give you everything."</p> 
<p><sup>4</sup> &quot;But you must not eat meat that has its 
lifeblood still in it. <sup>5</sup> And for your lifeblood I 
will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. 
And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow 
man."</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> &quot;Whoever sheds the blood of man, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by man shall his blood be shed; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for in the image of God <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has God made man."</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> "As for you, be fruitful and increase in 
number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Then God said to Noah and to his sons with 
him: <sup>9</sup> &quot;I now establish my covenant with you and with 
your descendants after you <sup>10</sup> and with every living 
creature that was with you—the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, 
all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth.
<sup>11</sup> I establish my covenant with you: Never again will 
all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood 
to destroy the earth.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>12</sup> And God said, &quot;This is the sign of the 
covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a 
covenant for all generations to come: <sup>13</sup> I have set 
my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and 
the earth. <sup>14</sup> Whenever I bring clouds over the earth 
and the rainbow appears in the clouds, <sup>15</sup> I will 
remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. 
Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
<sup>16</sup> Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will 
see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living 
creatures of every kind on the earth.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>17</sup> So God said to Noah, &quot;This is the sign of 
the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth.&quot; </p>
