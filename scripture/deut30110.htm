<p><sup>1</sup> “And when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, 
which I have set before you, and you call them to mind among all the nations where 
the Lord your God has driven you, <sup>2</sup> and return to the Lord your God, you 
and your children, and obey his voice in all that I command you today, with all your 
heart and with all your soul, <sup>3</sup> then the Lord your God will restore your 
fortunes and have mercy on you, and he will gather you again from all the peoples 
where the Lord your God has scattered you. <sup>4</sup> If your outcasts are in the 
uttermost parts of heaven, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from 
there he will take you. <sup>5</sup> And the Lord your God will bring you into the 
land that your fathers possessed, that you may possess it. And he will make you more 
prosperous and numerous than your fathers. <sup>6</sup> And the Lord your God will 
circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love the Lord 
your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live. 
<sup>7</sup> And the Lord your God will put all these curses on your foes and enemies 
who persecuted you. <sup>8</sup> And you shall again obey the voice of the Lord and 
keep all his commandments that I command you today. <sup>9</sup> The Lord your God will 
make you abundantly prosperous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb 
and in the fruit of your cattle and in the fruit of your ground. For the Lord will again 
take delight in prospering you, as he took delight in your fathers, <sup>10</sup> when 
you obey the voice of the Lord your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes that 
are written in this Book of the Law, when you turn to the Lord your God with all your 
heart and with all your soul.</p>
