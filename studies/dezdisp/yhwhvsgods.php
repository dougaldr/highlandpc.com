<p>A pastor named Joe McKeever wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, while the residents of Charlotte, N.C., were trying to
decide whether to name a new park after their most famous son, Billy
Graham, the city&#8217;s newspaper ran some of the mail they have received on
the
subject. Most writers felt this is a fitting tribute to the
world-famous
evangelist; some didn&#8217;t want to go that far; but the final letter
pulled me up
short.</p>
  <p>"Graham and his God don&#8217;t deserve honor," wrote Paul
Jamison. "He promotes a God who gets heinously violent (plagues,
floods, a
bloody sacrifice of his Son, threatens to destroy the earth and finally
a
torturous eternal punishment) for nonbelievers. So I say no to naming a
peaceful city park after a believer of (sic) this raging God."</p>
  <p>It probably does us church folk good to hear such from outsiders 
	occasionally. It’s like a glass of ice water in the face....</p>
  <p>I&#8217;m always fascinated when I hear people accusing
Bible-believers of concocting these stories. These are not
made-for-our-comfort
bedtime lullabies. They are in-your-face true accounts of the dealings
of
Almighty God with humankind. No one would voluntarily create such a
difficult
image of God. The gods earthlings manufacture tend to be the kind we
can manipulate
for our purposes. But this God will not be manipulated. One who knows
Him well
put it like this: "Our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He
pleases" (<b>Psalm 115:3</b>). (Pulpit Helps)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that false gods are generally gods people
believe they can manipulate.</p>
<p>But Yahweh, the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, is the true God whether we find
Him repulsive or not. And no amount of anger or denial is going to
change
reality. The God of the Bible cannot be controlled by us.</p>

<p><i>Where we have come from and
are going in this series so far.</i></p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Why these plagues were different.</p>
    <p>
John J. Davis, in his book Moses and the Gods of Egypt suggest 5
distinctives of these plagues.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Intensification: known plagues but worse
than ever.</p>
<li><p>Prediction: Moses
predicted the moment of arrival and departure.</p>
<li><p>Discrimination: distinction between the Hebrews
and the Egyptians in the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>,
9<sup>th</sup>,
and 10<sup>th</sup> plagues (v. 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex823etal.htm')" target=_self class=pop>8:23; 9:4, 6, 26; 10:23; 11:7</a>).
			<li><p>Orderliness (a progression of judgment in the plagues).</li>
			<li><p>Moral purpose (intended to teach a lesson).<p>Could have been
natural phenomenon specially controlled (like Jesus quelling the storm).</p></ol>
	<li>
	<p>The gods of Egypt.</p>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>
		<p>Well over 80 gods,
including the Pharaoh. </li>
		<li>
		<p><b>Exodus 12:12</b>, &quot;On that
same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every
firstborn--both men and animals--and I will bring judgment on all the
gods of Egypt. I am the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>.&quot; </li>
		<li>
		<p>Why so many
gods? Superstitions? Life is scary, and we want to get some sense of control. 
<i>False religion is usually about controlling
God, or God management.</i>&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	<li>
	<p>The pattern of the 10 plagues.</p>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>
		<p>The first nine and
then the grand finale, the 10<sup>th.</sup></li>
		<li>
		<p>The first three: Aaron
lifts up Moses rod. </li>
		<li>
		<p>The middle three: God
begins plague without Aaron or Moses. </li>
		<li>
		<p>The last three: Moses
lifts up his hands. </li>
	</ol>
	<li>
	<p>Perhaps over a period of eight months (clues within the text).</p>
</ol>
<li><p><b>The First Series of Plagues.</span></b></b></p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Water turned to blood

been real blood, probably not.</p>

Notes on
Exodus 2005 Edition, </p>
	<blockquote>Each year, toward the end of June, when the
waters
of the Nile begin to rise, they are colored a&nbsp;
dark red by the silt carried down from the headwaters. This
continues for three months, until the waters begin to abate, but the water,
meanwhile, is wholesome and
drinkable. The miracle of
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex71721.htm')" target=_self class=pop>7:17-21</a> 
involved three elements by which it differed from the accustomed phenomenon: the water was changed
by the smiting of Moses' rod; the water became undrinkable; and the condition lasted just seven days 
(v. 25).</blockquote>

        Constable, "The
dust...became gnats" (<b>v. 17</b>)
probably means that the gnats rose from the dust, resembled the dust in
that
they were so small, and were as numerous as the dust. Moses evidently
used the
language of appearance (here a metaphor).</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Magicians recognized this was not some
superior conjuring.</p>
<li><p><b>Exodus 8:19</b>, &quot;The
magicians
said to Pharaoh, 'This is the finger of God.' But Pharaoh's heart was
hard and he would not listen, just as the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had said.&quot;</p>
<li><p>God insulted: Geb,
who was
&quot;god&quot; of the earth or vegetation;
father of Osiris and husband of Nut; also Aker, god of the
earth.<br>

<li><p><b>What Can We Learn from These Plagues?</b></p>
<ol type=A><li><p>The righteous
often experience judgment with the wicked in this
life.</p>
    <p>
        Distinction
between the
Hebrews and the Egyptians in the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 7<sup>th</sup>,
9<sup>th</sup>, and 10<sup>th</sup> plagues 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex823etal.htm')" target=_self class=pop>v. 8:23; 9:4, 6, 26; 10:23; 11:7</a>).</p>
<li><p>We depend upon God for
our daily survival. 
    </p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Turning the Nile to blood is a reminder of how vulnerable 
we human beings are; we require clean water to drink or we die.  It doesn't 
matter if we build great monuments or are the most powerful nation on earth.  
We still must depend upon God for our most basic needs, like it or not, admit 
it or not.  Additionally, the righteous are challenged by those who can 
duplicate the plagues.  We must address many competing religions and 
philosophies, and it is not always easy.</p>
<li><p>The magicians are examples of the world, false religion, and the wisdom 
of man; and it is amazing what they can do.</p></ol>
<li><p>God does things His way,
not ours.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Didn&#8217;t act for 400 years.</p>
<li><p>Spread out the plagues for 8 months.</p>
<li><p>For some of them, His people had to suffer with the
Egyptians.</p>
<li><p>He orchestrated events so that He would get the glory.</p></ol>
<li><p>God can make us
miserable with
the very things we put above Him.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>The Egyptians worshipped a frog god, so God made them 
	miserable with frogs.</p>
<li><p>The Egyptians worshipped the Nile, so God made the Nile
detestable.</p></ol>
<li><p>The Pharaoh is typical
of an obstinate sinner.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>He is confronted
with God but has no interest.</p>
<li><p>When he gets
desperate, He acknowledges God but soon forgets Him.</p>
<li><p>He thinks even God
cannot control him.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Romans 9:17-18</b> says, &quot;For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: 
	'I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you 
	and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.' Therefore God has 
	mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to 
	harden.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Modern day example: Joseph Stalin, anti-Semitic, but allowed the formation of 
the nation of Israel when he could have vetoed it on the security council. 
Happened to be in a &quot;high&quot; mood and let it pass.</p></ol></ol></ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Main Idea:</span> <u>False

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>
Human nature has not changed; some of us reinvent God to
make a controllable deity; others of us are hardened against Him;
others are
deceived by this world's magicians and wise men.
        But when God is good and ready to enter the contest, He
always wins.</p>
