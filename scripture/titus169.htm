<p><sup>6</sup> An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man
whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and
disobedient.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup> Since an overseer is entrusted with God's work, he
must be blameless&#151;not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to
drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> Rather he
must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright,
holy and disciplined.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> He must hold firmly to the trustworthy
message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine
and refute those who oppose it.</p>
