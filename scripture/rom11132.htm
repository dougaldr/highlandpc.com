<p><sup>1</sup> I ask then: Did God reject his 
people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the 
tribe of Benjamin. <sup>2</sup> God did not 
reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in 
the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel:
<sup>3</sup> &quot;Lord, they have killed your 
prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying 
to kill me&quot;?
<sup>4</sup> And what was God's answer to him? &quot;I 
have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.&quot;
<sup>5</sup> So too, at the present time there is 
a remnant chosen by grace. <sup>6</sup> And if by 
grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be 
grace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> What then? What Israel sought so 
earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,
<sup>8</sup> as it is written: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;God gave them a spirit of stupor, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes so that they could not see <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ears so that they could not hear, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this very day.&quot;
<sup>9</sup> And David says: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;May their table become a snare and a trap, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stumbling block and a retribution for them. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> May their eyes be darkened so they 
cannot see, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their backs be bent forever.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> Again I ask: Did they stumble so 
as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, 
salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
<sup>12</sup> But if their transgression means 
riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much 
greater riches will their fullness bring!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> I am talking to you Gentiles. 
Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry
<sup>14</sup> in the hope that I may somehow 
arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
<sup>15</sup> For if their rejection is the 
reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the 
dead? <sup>16</sup> If the part of the dough 
offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is 
holy, so are the branches. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>  If some of the branches have 
been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among 
the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,
<sup>18</sup> do not boast over those branches. 
If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports 
you. <sup>19</sup>  You will say then, &quot;Branches 
were broken off so that I could be grafted in.&quot;
<sup>20</sup>  Granted. But they were broken off 
because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.
<sup>21</sup>  For if God did not spare the 
natural branches, he will not spare you either. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>  Consider therefore the kindness 
and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided 
that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
<sup>23</sup>  And if they do not persist in 
unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
<sup>24</sup>  After all, if you were cut out of 
an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a 
cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, 
be grafted into their own olive tree!</p>
<p><sup>25</sup>  I do not want you to be ignorant 
of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has 
experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come 
in. <sup>26</sup>  And so all Israel will be 
saved, as it is written: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The deliverer will come from Zion; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will turn godlessness away from Jacob. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>  And this is 
my covenant with them <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I take away their sins.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>  As far as the gospel is 
concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is 
concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
<sup>29</sup>  for God's gifts and his call are 
irrevocable. <sup>30</sup>  Just as you who were 
at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their 
disobedience, <sup>31</sup>  so they too have now 
become disobedient in order that they too may now 
receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you. 
<sup>32</sup>  For God has bound all men over to 
disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</p>
