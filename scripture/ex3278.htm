<p><sup>7</sup> Then the L<span>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Go down, because your people,
whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. <sup>8</sup> They have
been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an
idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to
it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of
Egypt.'</p>
