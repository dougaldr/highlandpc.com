<p><sup>18</sup> Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers 
and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had 
his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken. <sup>19</sup> They 
arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the 
synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. <sup>20</sup> When they asked him to spend more 
time with them, he declined. <sup>21</sup> But as he left, he promised, "I will come 
back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus. <sup>22</sup> When he 
landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.</p>

<p><sup>23</sup> After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and 
traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, 
strengthening all the disciples.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to 
Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures. 
<sup>25</sup> He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great 
fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John. 
<sup>26</sup> He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila 
heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more 
adequately.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him 
and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to 
those who by grace had believed. <sup>28</sup> For he vigorously refuted the Jews in 
public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p>
