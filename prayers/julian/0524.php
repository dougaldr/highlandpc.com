<p>Father,</p>
<p>Your Son, our Savior, is &quot;God's Mystery&quot; 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/col22.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Colossians 2:2</a>). 
Jesus Christ, the God-man, is reconciling people to God and bringing both 
believing Jews and believing gentiles into one common body. Although this 
aspect of the Messiah's person and work was implied in Old Testament times, it 
was not nearly as clear as it is under the New Covenant. Jesus Christ has been 
revealed to be the great Reconciler.</p>
<p>Lord, make me a person of discernment, discerning even 
myself. Help me remember that my emotions are not necessarily the result of 
reality but rather my <i>interpretation</i> of reality. I can interpret the 
actions of others in the best personal light, or in the worst personal light, or 
somewhere between the two. My personal chemistry, the stresses of life, or even 
levels of sleep affect how I interpret things. Help me to distinguish between 
fact and impression, event and interpretation of event. Give me a love for 
truth.</p>
<p>Lord, I have requests to bring before Your throne today. 
Please intervene for the following needs, wishes and wants: __________.</p>
<p>Father, the qualities of faith, hope and love measure my 
maturity. Help me to grow in all three of these. Even though I acknowledge 
that love is the greatest of these, they are all three crucial and 
non-negotiable. Help me to produce works of faith, labors of love and to 
exemplify the steadfastness of hope 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/1thes13.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>). 
You want Your children to be known by their love and I want to be faithful to that calling.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the North African nation of Libya. There 
are no opportunities in this land for open evangelism and only .3% of the 
population falls under the category of born-again evangelical. Secret police 
monitor to make sure evangelism does not occur and almost all of the Christians 
in the land are foreigners. O Lord, use radio, literature and Internet access 
to reach Libyans for Jesus Christ. May the number of Christians grow 
by twenty times over the next decade and may true religious freedom reign in this 
land. Hover over Libya, O Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>Thank You for Christian Missionary Fellowship whose 
purpose is &quot;to evangelize the non-Christian people of the world.&quot; Today, CMF 
missionaries are seeking to keep up with modern challenges: &quot;globalization, 
urbanization and the tremendous worldwide growth in the numbers of young people 
all present opportunities for ministry—opportunities for visions of 
ever-improving ways to draw people into relationship with Christ and His Church. 
Another challenge is sharing the Gospel in countries considered closed and among 
people considered unreceptive. But wherever the unreached are, CMF wants to be 
there...whether as church planters, counselors, teachers, or entrepreneurs...our 
team members will be deeply involved in sharing their faith and establishing 
groups of believers.&quot; Yes, Lord, I say, &quot;Amen—may it be so.&quot; Provide for 
them, protect them, grant them unity and harmony and may Your Spirit prosper 
their efforts. May You be glorified through them.</p>
<p>Now, today Lord, may You be glorified in my life, I ask in 
the Name of Jesus, Amen.</p>
