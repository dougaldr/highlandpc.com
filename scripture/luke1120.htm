<p><sup>1</sup> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things 
that have been fulfilled among us, <sup>2</sup> just as they were handed 
down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of 
the word. <sup>3</sup> Therefore, since I myself have carefully 
investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to 
write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, 
<sup>4</sup> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have 
been taught.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest 
named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his 
wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. <sup>6</sup> Both of 
them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's 
commandments and regulations blamelessly. <sup>7</sup> But they had no 
children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along 
in years.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was 
serving as priest before God, <sup>9</sup> he was chosen by lot, 
according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the 
Lord and burn incense. <sup>10</sup> And when the time for the burning 
of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at 
the right side of the altar of incense. <sup>12</sup> When Zechariah saw 
him, he was startled and was gripped with fear. <sup>13</sup> But the 
angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been 
heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him 
the name John. <sup>14</sup> He will be a joy and delight to you, and 
many will rejoice because of his birth, <sup>15</sup> for he will be 
great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other 
fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from 
birth. <sup>16</sup> Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to 
the Lord their God. <sup>17</sup> And he will go on before the Lord, in 
the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to 
their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to 
make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? 
I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the 
presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you 
this good news. <sup>20</sup> And now you will be silent and not able 
to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my 
words, which will come true at their proper time." </p>
