<p>Father,</p>
<p>Your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, is many things. He is God 
in the flesh, the Savior, the King of Israel and the Head of the Church. But 
He is among many things a Teacher. He taught and trained His disciples especially
focusing upon those He name &quot;apostles.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank You that Jesus is constantly teaching me! He teaches 
me first and foremost through His Word by His Spirit. He teaches me through 
those He has gifted within the church. As I read the Words of Jesus, or those 
He trained or those who prophesied of Him, I am directly connected to Him. 
Thank You, Lord, that the Great Teacher, our Lord Jesus Christ, teaches me! 
Help me to be an eager learner.</p>
<p>My Master, I know that there are many false teachers out 
there, too. Lord, Peter warned us: &quot;But there were also false prophets among the 
people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly 
introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought 
them....&quot; (<b>2 Peter 2:1-2a</b>) Lord, some people who once professed the faith become 
trapped and brainwashed by cults and false religions. Most of these have an 
authority other than the Bible—other supposed scriptures—while others have a 
prophet or &quot;great leader.&quot; O Father, stop the spread of the cults. May 
churches that are true to the obvious teaching of the Word of God grow while 
those who manipulate Your Word decline, I pray. </p>
<p>Protect those who are close to me from these errors, O 
Lord.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some requests to bring before Your throne. 
They are: __________.</p>
<p>Help me with my thought life today. Help me think positive 
and pleasant thoughts today, thoughts that please You.</p>
<p>Lord, the United Kingdom has been a great nation for the 
Kingdom of God in the past. In a way, UK evangelicals set the tone for the 
evangelical church in the U.S. and together these two nations accounted for 
the vast majority of missionaries in the world, thus spreading their influence 
to the four corners of the earth. But the U.K. has fallen away from You, O 
Lord. Now only 8.5% of its 59 million people claim to be born-again believers. 
O Father, bring a great revival to this nation. May it once again become a 
bastion for the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Remove the spirit of cynicism that has 
swept the land and help people humble themselves and turn to You, O Lord.</p>
<p>Lord, bless the Mission America Coalition, &quot;an 
unprecedented coalition of Christian leaders who have prayerfully come together 
to mobilize the church for praying, caring and sharing the Gospel of Jesus 
Christ in deed and word.... Leaders from 81 denominations, over 350 ministries and 
dozens of ministry networks have been involved.... MAC calls for active 
participation in The Great Commission of Jesus Christ.&quot; Their mission statement 
is: &quot;The whole church taking the whole gospel to the whole nation—and to the 
world!&quot; O Lord, bless this effort. Provide, 
protect, prosper, grant harmony and empower Christians in the U.S. to actively 
influence their society and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Help me to influence my sphere today, I pray in the 
Messiah's Name, Amen.</p>
