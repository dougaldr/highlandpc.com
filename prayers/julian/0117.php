<br>January 17

<p>Great God and King of Kings,</p>
<p>I worship You as the Infinite One. You, O Lord, have no 
boundaries. You fill the entire universe, and Your attributes are extending 
outward toward infinity. Just as we never run out of numbers, so neither are 
Your attributes exhausted nor You power limited. When we consider the billions 
of stars, some of which are actually galaxies whose light combines as though 
they were but single stars, we have to admit that we cannot comprehend the 
vastness of the universe. But, You, Lord, are so much greater, just as infinity 
is greater than any number.</p>
<p>Today, Lord, I praise You for my coming bodily 
resurrection.&nbsp; I know that, at death, my soul shall be immediately ushered into 
Your presence, but my body will decay unless I am alive at the time of Christ’s 
return to the sky and thus avoid death. Then my body will be resurrected to 
become an immortal body, like that of the resurrected Jesus.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to develop humility. You command me to 
humble myself before You, but You also want me to be humble in my dealing with 
others. Help me to not look out for only my own interests, but the interest of 
others.</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may 
fill me. I find my strength in His power, not my own. May Your Spirit control 
me today.</p>
<p>Dear God, I ask You to help me get along with my 
neighbors. Help me not only to be at peace with them, but to develop a positive 
relationship with them. If they do not know Christ, use me to reach them, I 
pray.</p>
<p>I pray for my lost friends and family members, including: __________. 
Father, please send Your Spirit to draw them to Yourself 
and grant them the repentance that leads to life.</p>
<p>Today I remember that part of the United Kingdom called 
England. O Lord, at one time so many knew You there, but the percentage of 
evangelical Christians has significantly dwindled. May Your Spirit once more 
sweep across that land. May the number of evangelical Christians triple in the 
next decade, and may their level of commitment deepen.</p>
<p>Dear God, bless Bible Related Ministries as they seek to 
rescue divided churches. Provide for them; give them success for the sake of 
Your body.</p>
<p>Today I remember the chief justice of the Supreme Court. 
Bless him/her, and help the chief justice to fear you, to seek truth and 
objectivity, and to use his/her position for good as You define good.</p>
<p>Shower me with 
strength and joy today, I pray, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
