<p>Almighty Father,</p>
<p>You are the God of the laws and routines. Certainly You 
vary that routine, but Your Son keeps holding the universe together. Every day 
the sun rises, every day the sun sets. Gravity works everyday, 24/7. 
Scientists and physicists can discover the laws of the science because You 
ordained them. Despite the chaos in our universe as a result of the curse, we 
find a great deal of order, constancy and dependability. After You created 
all, You said it was all very good. It isn't very good now, for evil is the 
ruining of the good. But it is remarkable to see what is still good. We can 
therefore depend upon the daily cycle and the annual cycle. We know the earth 
will keep its peculiar tilt so that the polar icecaps do not melt and destroy 
the world by a flood. After the Flood of Noah, You promised there would be no 
more worldwide floods and the rainbow reminds us of this covenant.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, for the assurance of answered prayer. As 
Jesus said in <b>John 16:24</b>, &quot;Until now you have not asked for anything 
in my name. Ask 
and you will receive and your joy will be complete.&quot; Although I know this 
general promise is not a detailed treatise on prayer, it assures me that You 
want me to ask and it also tells me that You are concerned about my joy. And, 
so Lord, I ask You to meet my needs and bless those close to me.</p>
<p>Father, thank You for my senses. In Your grace and 
goodness, keep them all healthy and help me to appreciate them and use them in 
ways that please You. Help me to discover the joys of being a human being 
created in Your image, yet help me to enjoy life in ways consistent with Your 
revealed will. I recognize that if I enjoy myself in legitimate ways, I am less 
prone to enjoy myself in illegitimate ways.</p>
<p>Lord, the Hubei Province of China especially needs Your 
help. Perhaps 1% of the population is made up of born-again evangelicals and 
the government in this region is especially oppressive. The 60 million people 
in this province need to hear of Jesus, but even the house churches are few, 
particularly in the cities. O Lord, change the hearts of the political leaders 
of this area. I pray that the Gospel outreach here would expand a hundredfold 
over the next decade and that the number of believers would double within the 
next five years.</p>
<p>Praise Your Name for Commission to Every Nation, a 
non-denominational missionary sending agency &quot;helping ordinary people partner 
with God to accomplish the extraordinary.... Missionaries go out to six world 
regions to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ in word and deed.&quot; O Lord, bless 
this ministry. Provide for the workers. Grant them harmony among themselves, 
protect them, grant them good health, empower them by Your Spirit and give them 
much fruit for their labors, I ask.</p>
<p>Now reward me with fruit for my labors and glorify 
Yourself through me, I ask in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
