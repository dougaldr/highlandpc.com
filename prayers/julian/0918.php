<p>My God and my Father,</p>
<p>You are distinct from Your creation, not part of it. Although You are present 
in the universe, You existed before the universe came into being. Although Your 
creation demonstrates Your handiwork, You are not part of Your creation. There 
is You, O God, and then there is creation. You created everything except You by 
You. You are uncreated and eternal, always the same. You are the cause for all 
that is. Past, present and future are the same to You. You are the great, 
&quot;I Am.&quot; You are Yahweh, the Lord.</p>
<p>Father, I thank You for Your Holy Spirit! He is convicting the world of sin, 
righteousness and judgment and restraining evil. Because of His influence, 
things are not as bad as they could be or as they one day will be! Although 
human beings are depraved—meaning helpless to remedy their lost condition—we 
are not as bad as we could be. Between our consciences and the influence of Your 
Spirit, much evil is held back. Thank You, Lord.</p>
<p>My Father in heaven, help me to be wise here on earth. Make me be a person of 
discernment. There is no shortage of false teachers; some are obvious, others 
are slick. Help me not be gullible but discerning, discreet and perceptive. The 
best way for me to recognize error is to know the truth. Make me a person of the 
Book, O Lord.</p>
<p>I remember parents. Lord, parents are so important to 
those little ones entrusted to their care. May parents everywhere protect and 
train their children in humane and balanced ways. Help them to love their 
children, not to spoil them and to encourage them toward positive directions. 
We pray that Christian parents would prove to be consistent role models for 
their young ones. Send angels to protect them, I pray.</p>
<p>I remember the Panjab State of India in my prayer today 
with its 24 million people. Lord, nearly 1% claim to be born-again 
evangelicals. As small a percentage as this is, thank You, Lord, that the 
church is growing and church attendance tripled during the 1990s. Father, do 
a great work in this land. May the number of believers double within the next 5 
years, I ask. I pray that every people group in this state would have at least 
one church functioning within the next five years. May Your Spirit hover over 
this area!</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for the ministry of International Christian Concern, &quot;a non 
profit and interdenominational human rights organization...dedicated to 
assisting and sustaining Christians who are victims of persecution and 
discrimination due to practicing their faith. Since 1995, has been assisting 
the persecuted church. ICC builds, assists, sustains, raises awareness and 
provides advocacy for the worldwide persecuted Christian Church striving to 
exemplify faithfulness to our Lord.&quot; Father, bless this important work—and 
Lord, may persecution against Christians and other religious groups—be a 
thing of the past. May a new wave of freedom sweep over our world.</p>
<p>Help me to freely share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with someone soon, I pray.</p>
