<br>Obstacles to Good Interpretation

<div>
<p>There are positives and negatives in the science of 
interpretation—that which hinders and that which leads us the right way. 
First, let's look at the negatives, what I call the obstacles.

<p><b>
1. <u>Arrogance.</u></b> 
This is by far the biggest obstacle. Thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) 
of people think they have a special corner on God, that God reveals to them what 
He does not reveal to others, that they have obtained a level of spirituality, 
intelligence, or giftedness rarely given to others. Spurgeon said this, &quot;If it 
is true, it's not new. If it's new, it's not true.&quot; Although it is likely that 
difficult passages, etc., could open up through new insights or discoveries, 
beware of your heart, which, the Bible says, is &quot;…deceitful and desperately 
wicked.&quot; Although the Holy Spirit can teach us, He does so in accord with the 
Body of Christ and with accountability to that Body (the prophets are subject to 
the prophets). </p>
<p>
Unfortunately, when arrogance takes over (and this is the powerful sin of <b>Isaiah 
14</b>, the one that turned Lucifer into Satan), the elders of a church are 
considered spiritually immature and inferior. This is how cults and heresies 
are started. Check arrogance. Practice accountability and teachability.</p>
<p><b>
2. <u>Paradigm blindness.</u></b> 
Because we assume so much, and are usually unaware of our assumptions, we can 
become blind to what is. Hearing we do not hear. We have a certain pattern 
in our mind, and we reject that which does not neatly fit into our pattern. 
Many Christians have rejected the concept that God would restore the nation of 
Israel in the end times because they viewed Jews as Christ killers and were 
anti-semitic.</p>
<p><b>
3. <u>Ignorance.</u></b> It is not bad 
to be ignorant if you KNOW you are ignorant and are addressing that ignorance. 
For example, many Christians were against heart transplants in the late 
60's/early 70's because Jesus might be in your heart and then He is taken out 
during a transplant. I'm not kidding—it was a major issue in its day.</p>
<p><b>
4. <u>Lack of challenge.</u></b> 
In order to test an interpretation, it is crucial to associate with people who 
can and will challenge your interpretation. It might be flawed in a way you 
never thought of.</p>
<p><b>
5. <u>Lack of theological 
framework.</u></b>
We must develop our 
theological framework from clear Scripture so that we do not get off on 
tangents. Or, to put this simply, there are certain truths so clear that we 
must camp on them. We can then interpret obscure verses in light of them. 
Otherwise our theology will become schizophrenic (e.g., one day believing we can 
lose our salvation, another not; one day believing in salvation by grace through 
faith, another day through works, etc.).</p>
<b>General Rules for Interpreting the Scriptures</b>
<p>
Purposes: (1) to be objective and logical so that we conform to the Scriptures 
rather than conforming the Scriptures to what we want them to say; (2) to avoid 
error and find the paths of truth and righteousness (right belief), and (3) to 
find direction and guidance for living the Christian life. Language is not like 
mathematics but is much more fluid. Since the Bible is BOTH the Word of God and 
the word of man (God used humans in the process of giving His Word), and since 
we think in terms of words and language, we must try to <b><u>enter into the 
original intent of the human author</u></b> while respecting Scripture as the 
inspired, inerrant Word of God. Here are some rules to guide us in that 
direction:</p>
<p><b>
1.</b> Follow 
customary usage of language. Interpret the Bible normally with a flexible 
literalness, allowing for figures of speech, etc. Interpret poetry as poetry, 
instruction as instruction, history as history. &quot;If the plain sense makes 
sense, look for no other sense.&quot; What is often portrayed as &quot;spiritual&quot; is 
nothing more than imaginative or beautiful or emotionally moving—but is it 
accurate? Don't be afraid to pour cold water on mystical interpretations. Pay 
attention to the author's word choice and grammar.</p>
<p><b>
2.</b> Ask the 
right questions <b><i>(THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT):</i></b>
<blockquote>
<b>(1) <u>What was the original intent of the human author?</u></b> 
How would he have understood what he wrote? What did he have in mind? In 
certain instances of prophecy, he may not have understood the meaning of what he 
was writing (e.g., Revelation). But assume that the author did understand what 
he was writing in non-prophetic portions (e.g., Paul understood what he meant in 
Romans, etc.).</p>

<p><b>(2) <u>How would the original audience have understood a text or 
a teaching?</u></b> Try to enter into the culture and mindset of the 
original recipients. How would they have understood what was taught? Do not 
write off a teaching/command as &quot;cultural&quot; unless it is based on culture. If 
its basis is theological or historical, it very likely still stands. (e.g., 
Baptism has roots in the Jewish culture, but was commanded for non-Jews as well; 
it is therefore still applicable.)
</blockquote>
<p><b>
3.</b> Interpret 
in light of the context, including verses nearby, the chapter, and the book. In 
one text, &quot;all&quot; may mean &quot;all the people in the world of all time,&quot; in another, 
&quot;all in a group.&quot;</p>
<p><b>
4.</b> Interpret 
Scripture by Scripture. Although there is much diversity in Scripture, it is a 
unity, inspired by God. Seeming contradictions are just that, seeming. Often 
verses in one place build upon verses from another text. For example, the New 
Testament builds upon the foundation of the Old Testament and assumes the reader 
is familiar with it. Generally speaking, it is most objective to interpret 
Scripture through the lens of PREVIOUSLY written Scripture. This is called the 
principle of Progressive Revelation. Since Moses would not have had the Acts of 
the Apostles, it is better to interpret Acts in light of Genesis rather than the 
other way around.</p>
<p><b>
5.</b> Do the 
&quot;Deductive Check.&quot; If you come to a conclusion through Bible study, double 
check it like you would a math problem. For example, suppose you came to 
conclude that those who minister should not take support from anyone but work 
full time. You then look at the life of godly examples and see what they did. 
Did Paul or Jesus, for example, take financial support? You come across <b>Luke 
8:1-3</b> and find out that Christ did indeed receive financial support. Your 
conclusion is therefore wrong. Incidentally, this is a good reason why you need 
to be constantly in the Scripture and why you should not form conclusions too 
quickly, but give them time to be tested.</p>
<p><b>
6.</b> Keep in 
mind the distinction between God's plan for the nation of Israel, His plan for 
the Church, and His plan for the establishment of the Kingdom on Earth (the 
Millennium). Although we can profit from studying all Scripture (<b>2 Timothy 
3:16-17</b>), all Scripture is not directed at us. In the Old Testament, for 
example, we look for principles. Yet we are not required to eat kosher, join 
the nation of Israel, nor can we claim the curses and blessings of Israel for 
our nation. <b>2 Chronocles. 7:14</b> has a wonderful principle attached to it, but it is 
not a promise made to the U.S.A.</p>
<p><b>
7.</b> Allow for 
Progressive Revelation (mentioned above). Besides interpreting the Bible 
progressively, we must not hold Bible characters responsible for knowing later 
revelation, nor to be bound by it. For example, Abraham was married to his 
half-sister, Sarah. Since no law from God had been given against this, this was 
not a wrong union THEN. After the time of Moses, it would have been.</p>
<p><b>
8.</b> Go into 
Bible study carefully, prayerfully, and with a desire to cultivate the Spirit's 
work in your life. Since the Spirit of God inspired Scripture, His help in 
unlocking its meaning is a must. He is the Spirit of Truth.</p>
<p><b>
9.</b> Do not go 
into the Bible with a pre-existing agenda or you will find what you are looking 
for. This is why unstable people or people bent on being extreme find plenty of 
ammunition in Scripture. Sad to say, but for some the Bible can be a dangerous 
book because it lends &quot;authority&quot; to their obsession. We are to enter Bible 
study with a teachable, submissive spirit.</p>
<p><b>
10.</b> Discuss 
your understanding of Scripture with others who are knowledgeable of the Word. 
Let them challenge some of your conclusions and see if they hold water.</p>
<p><b>
11.</b> 
Interpret the unclear in light of the clear. And remember, you can leave 
unclear passages sit. Perhaps they will become clear in time, but if not, you 
need not embrace a particular interpretation that is unsatisfying or strained. 
Just be content to leave some verses alone.</p>
<p><b>
12.</b> Ask how 
strained an interpretation is. There are often several possible meanings to a 
verse, but some may seem like quite a stretch. No matter how careful we are, we 
will need to occasionally do some straining.</p>
<p><b>
13.</b> Remember 
that the Scripture is not the whole of what the original readers had. In <b>1 
Corinthians</b>, for example, Paul is answering questions that the Corinthians sent 
him. We do not know for sure what the questions were; we can only try to 
reconstruct them. Yet there are many related issues that are not discussed 
because Paul had taught them well about those issues when he was with them. So 
we must remember that what we have are a collection of partial teachings and 
need to <b><u>be careful about recognizing the difference between truth and 
whole truth</u></b>.</p>
<p><b>
14.</b> Avoid 
&quot;camping out&quot; on unclear verses. Generally speaking, stand firm where the 
Scriptures are clear, allow freedom where the Scriptures are unclear. Do not 
see interpretations as always black and white but allow for shades of gray. For 
example, I am about 65% sure of a Pretribulation Rapture but 100% sure of the 
deity of Christ.</p>
<p><b>
15.</b> Use 
reliable reference material produced by Bible-believing (conservative), 
solidly-based scholars (Ryrie, Feinberg, Sproule, F.F. Bruce, Walvoord, 
Pentecost, etc.) or Bible teachers (Wiersbe, MacArthur, Swindoll).</p>
<b>Special Interpretive Rules for the Gospels</b><p><b>
1.</b> Do not 
view parables as allegories unless Christ does; otherwise, look for the main 
lesson only.</p>
<p><b>
2.</b> Much of 
Christ's ministry was restricted to the Jews and relates to the Law. Remember 
that Jesus taught as a Jewish Rabbi to Jews, and so if you are to understand the 
import of His teaching, it is helpful to enter into the Jewish culture of the 
first century. Much like applying the Old Testament, we must sometimes look for 
principles (e.g., leaving one's gifts on the altar and being reconciled—we do 
not have an altar nor do we have sacrifices). Other times, Jesus was teaching 
the church, which was yet future according to <b>Matthew 16:18</b>.</p>
<p><b>
3.</b> Like 
modern preachers/teachers, Jesus taught the same material to different groups of 
people at different times with variations. Do not assume similar events are the 
same events (e.g., Christ fed two separate multitudes).</p>
<p><b>
4.</b> The 
Gospels select materials around their themes. Three of them have an awful lot 
of overlap: Matthew, Mark, and Luke (they are called the synoptic, &quot;with one 
eye&quot; Gospels). Almost everything in Mark can be found in Matthew or Luke, 
whereas about 50% of Luke is unique. John's Gospel is overwhelming unique, 
perhaps 90% so. Putting the Gospels together provides us with a harmony, which 
is what I will be working from.</p>
<p><b>
5.</b> 
Jesus sometimes used the “hot and cold” method of teaching, an established 
Rabbinic method which takes things to the extreme. It is my belief that a good 
portion of the Sermon on the Mount is best understood in this manner.</p>
