<p><sup>34</sup> Whenever God slew them, they 
would seek him; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they eagerly turned to him again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was 
their Rock, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that God Most High was their Redeemer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>36</sup> But then they would flatter 
him with their mouths, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lying to him with their tongues; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>37</sup> their hearts were not loyal to 
him, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were not faithful to his covenant. </p>
<p><sup>38</sup> Yet he was merciful; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he forgave their iniquities <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did not destroy them. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time after time he restrained his anger <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did not stir up his full wrath. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were 
but flesh, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a passing breeze that does not return. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled 
against him in the desert <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and grieved him in the wasteland! </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>41</sup> Again and again they put God 
to the test; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they vexed the Holy One of Israel. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>42</sup> They did not remember his 
power— <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the day he redeemed them from the oppressor.</p>
