<p><sup>8</sup>
But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still
sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more
shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> For if, when we
were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how
much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</p>
