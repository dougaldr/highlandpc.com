<br>Prayer for the Salvation of a Friend, Acquaintance, or Relative
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Lord, I pray for __________. You know all 
hearts, You know all situations, and Your Spirit is able to break through the 
toughest barriers.</p>
<p>We know we are born with the knowledge that there must be a 
God somewhere. Our consciences trouble us, and we may excuse our sin or deny its 
reality, or we may face the guilt of our wrongs. Help __________ to face the 
reality that we are all breakers of the God's divine Law.</p>
<p>May the Spirit of God bring deep conviction of sin and 
helplessness to __________'s heart. May He draw __________ to You and 
remove all hostility toward You.</p>
<p>O Lord, help __________ see the need to turn from 
sin and turn in faith and trust in Jesus Christ. Help __________ rest 
in the work of Christ for their salvation. Help __________ understand 
that there is nothing we can do to merit forgiveness, but that Jesus paid our 
sin debt by shedding his blood on the cross. Help __________ believe with 
their heart in the Lord Jesus and confess with the mouth that Christ is also 
risen from the dead.</p>
<p>To be saved, one must want to be saved from sin. Grant 
__________ repentance and faith in Jesus Christ. Your Word promises, 
&quot;Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved&quot; (<b>Acts 16:31</b>). Help 
__________ believe in truth and with genuine commitment, I pray, in Jesus' Name, 
Amen.</p>
