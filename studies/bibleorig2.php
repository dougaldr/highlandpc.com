<p id="pgt"><span class="pgh">Biblical/Doctrinal Studies:</span>
<br>The Origin of the Bible, Part II: The Torah
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>In my previous article, I addressed how every part of the 
Bible is locked into all the other parts.  If you believe one section, this 
more or less leads you to the rest.  This is called &quot;the colophon principle.&quot;  If you 
believe in Jesus, for example, you must logically accept and revere the Old 
Testament because He did.  You would also expect to see the apostolic writings 
included as Scripture, because Jesus trained the apostles as His fully 
authorized representatives in ways that no one else has ever been trained or 
authorized.</p>
<p>This same colophon principle makes it clear that the 
apocryphal books included in the Roman Catholic Bible should not be included in 
our Old Testament for they are not quoted as Scripture.  There are a few issues 
to clean up (the quotation from Enoch in <b>Jude</b> and the authorship of <b>2 Peter</b>, for 
example), but I will address such residual matters later.</p>
<p>Today's focus is the Torah, the first five books of the 
Bible드lso known as &quot;the Law&quot; or &quot;the Pentateuch.&quot;  We already demonstrated 
that archaeologists have discovered evidence of writing which may be traced back 
to perhaps 3,000 B.C., a full 1,500 years before the time of Moses.  Since 
liberal* scholars can no longer argue that Moses could not have written the 
Torah because writing had not yet been invented, they have proposed other 
theories that circumvent his authorship.  You must understand that skeptics will 
never accept the supernatural inspiration of Scripture because they have ruled 
that out beforehand (This is called <i>a priori</i> reasoning.).  So when one 
attempt at demythologizing does not work, they simply invent another one.  It is 
not intellectually chic in scholastic circles to believe God inspired the 
Scriptures; those who do are often humiliated or viewed with disbelief and 
contempt.  (Who said peer pressure is a teen thing?)  Even Christian students in 
secular universities know the sting of a liberal professor's greatest weapon: 
intimidation by sarcasm. </p>
<p>One popular theory that has been well received by liberals든ven though there 
is no real evidence to support it들s the JEDP theory.  
This is a theory that the Torah was constructed from four different religious 
traditions, each with their unique emphasis. Others believe that the Torah was 
put together by Ezra or evolved in the 6<sup>th</sup> century B.C., rather than 
being written by Moses about 1450 B.C.</p>
<p>Although we cannot <i>prove</i> that the Torah was actually 
written by Moses (even if we found the Ark of the Covenant with the tablets of 
the Law inside), Christians believe that such is the case because the rest of 
the Bible attributes the Torah to Moses 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt84.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 8:4</a>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt1978.htm')" target=_self class=pop>19:7-8</a>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/mark710.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Mark 7:10</a>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/luke2427.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Luke 24:27</a>
for just a few examples).  For the Christian, the assertions by Jesus that 
Moses wrote the Torah settles the matter.  But is there other evidence to make 
it reasonable to believe that Moses wrote the Torah?</p>
<p>Yes, in a way.  Throughout the Torah, we read of historical 
events and cultural behaviors that a 6<sup>th</sup> century author could not 
have known.  And we have some significant archaeological evidence.  We know, for 
example, that Solomon built the Temple about 1,000 B.C., and that it was 
constructed based on the Tabernacle description in the Torah.  We have evidence 
that the Hebrews indeed were enslaved in Egypt at one time.  We know that Sodom 
and Gomorrah were indeed destroyed by fire.  We know that the Hittites did 
actually exist.</p>
<p>We have recently discovered the route of the Exodus and the 
&quot;shelf&quot; in the Red Sea that allowed the children of Israel (about 2 million 
people) to cross without having to ascend down one mile into the seabed and then 
up a steep mile to the other side.  We have evidence of calcified chariot wheels 
in the seabed along this shelf (the Egyptian army was drowned).  We have a 
videotape with footage documenting this in our church library (<i>The Exodus 
Revealed</i>).  This is a relatively late-breaking discovery (early 1990s).</p>
<p>The 1990s discovery of <i>The Real Mount Sinai</i> (as 
documented in the DVD/Video of the same name, also in our church library) traces 
the entire path of the Exodus and the events of the Book of Numbers.  One 
summary of the video found on the Internet puts it more succinctly than I 
could.  Bob Cornuke and Larry Williams engaged드nd videotaped듮he adventure 
of a lifetime, sneaking into Saudi Arabia.  We pick up the action midstream:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, slipping  past the guards at night and 
digging under the fence, Bob and Larry continued their adventure.  Just south of 
the mountain, they found what they believe may have been the battlefield of Rephidim 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex1718.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 17:1,8</a>; 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex192.htm')" target=_self class=pop>19:2</a>;
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/num331415.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Numbers 33:14-15</a>),
 a dozen football fields in size.</p>
<p>They also found a large altar made up of extremely large, 
stacked boulders.  On one of them they found pictographs of <i>cattle</i>, not 
sheep native to Arabia.  These pictographs resembled the Apis bulls of Egypt.  
Could this have been the altar for the Golden Calf? (Cf. <b>Exodus 32</b>.)</p>
<p>As one reaches the higher elevations of Jabal al Lawz, the 
ground turns black, dark like obsidian; the rocks look almost like coal.  (Yet 
when they're broken, they were actually granite.)  They were not volcanic; they 
appeared as if scorched from above 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex1918.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 19:18</a>).  
They even found an unusually large crevice in which a man could hide 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex3322.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 33:22</a>?). 
They also found an old stream bed; &quot;the brook that descended out of the mount&quot; 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/deut921.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Deuteronomy 9:21</a>?).</p>
<p>At the base of the mount, they also found two huge 
rocks듫erhaps 60 ft. long등edged together, with a flat stone in the middle; 
possibly the altar of the Bible? 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex202426.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 20:24-26</a>). 
Nearby, they also found the remains of the 12 pillars, all in a row, each one about 18 ft. in diameter, 
spaced 5 ft. apart 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex244.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 24:4</a>).  
Around the mountain, about 400 yards distant, they also found what appeared to be 
the boundary markers, the bounds set by Moses at the base of the mountain 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex19122123.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 19:12,21-23</a>)  
(source and more details:

<p>This video/DVD is so important, we have viewed it twice in 
Sunday School and twice on Sunday nights.</p>
<p>There are many, many evidences that the Torah goes back to 
the time of Moses.  Although Genesis may have been compiled by Moses from 
preexisting sources, and although Deuteronomy was probably finished up by 
Joshua, everything is in place to make it reasonable to believe that Moses did 
indeed pen the Torah, just as Jesus, Paul, and the rest of the apostles believed드nd as Orthodox Jews likewise believe.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Apostle John labels Moses and Jesus as the 
initiators of distinct eras: &quot;For the law was given through Moses,  grace and 
truth came through Jesus Christ&quot; (<b>John 1:17</b>).</p>
<p>And when it comes to Christian Apologetics, this is where we must always leave matters.  We cannot prove that our 
beliefs are correct beyond a shadow of a doubt.  We can only make the argument 
that our beliefs are reasonable.  Faith does not run contrary to reason, but it 
always exists with the option to doubt.  So I leave you with this conclusion: it 
is reasonable to believe that Moses wrote the Torah.</p>
<p>(*Note:  In this article, the term &quot;liberal&quot; does not refer 
to <i>political</i> liberalism, but <i>theological liberalism</i>, which is 
basically a denial of Biblical miracles, supernaturalism, the virgin birth, 
physical resurrection, deity of Christ, or inspiration of the Bible.)</p>
