<p>&nbsp;<sup>46</sup> And Mary said: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My soul glorifies the Lord <br>
&nbsp;<sup>47</sup> and my spirit rejoices in God 
my Savior, <br>
&nbsp;<sup>48</sup> for he has been mindful <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the humble state of his servant. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From now on all generations will call me blessed, <br>
&nbsp;<sup>49</sup> for the Mighty One has done 
great things for me— <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holy is his name. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>50</sup> His mercy extends to those who 
fear him, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from generation to generation. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>51</sup> He has performed mighty deeds with 
his arm; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>52</sup> He has brought down rulers from 
their thrones <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but has lifted up the humble. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>53</sup> He has filled the hungry with good 
things <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but has sent the rich away empty. <br>
&nbsp;<sup>54</sup> He has helped his servant Israel,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembering to be merciful <br>
&nbsp;<sup>55</sup> to Abraham and his descendants 
forever, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even as he said to our fathers.&quot;</p>
