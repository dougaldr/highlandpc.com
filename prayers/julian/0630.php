<p>My Awesome God,</p>

<p>I thank You that You appeared to Jacob as a man. You 
wrestled with him through the night and afterward touched his hip socket, 
dislocating it. Jacob would not let You go until You blessed him 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/gen322232.htm')" target="_self" class="pop">Genesis 32:22-32</a>). 
For the rest of his life, that limp reminded him that he had 
wrestled with You, O Lord. Jacob needed to be humbled and You humbled him. He 
needed to understand that You had chosen to bless him in unique ways and You 
made him to understand that. Although he repeatedly failed You, You did not give 
up on him, for You are a God Who perseveres in His purpose. You orchestrated 
today's events from currents You sent rolling centuries or even millennia ago. 
Although so many of Your deeds seem scattered, random and disconnected, You have 
an intricate plan far more detailed than we can imagine.</p>

<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You 
today. They are: __________.</p>

<p>First John says that if I confess my sins, You are faithful 
and&nbsp;just to forgive me those sins, and You will purify me from 
all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 John 1:9</b>). I confess the sins I am aware of now and I 
ask Your Spirit to search my heart (<i>Pause to admit them to God.</i>).</p>

<p>Lord, the nation of Niger is a poor nation and such is the 
case as far as the church goes as well. Only .1%  
claim to be born-again evangelicals. Almost 98% of the population claim Islam 
for their religion. Nonetheless, this nation has a fair amount of religious 
freedom. O Lord, may the church double every year over the next five years. 
Give wisdom to the missionaries and help the believers to be bold for Jesus. May 
Your Spirit do a great work in this land. Help 
Christians reach the many unreached people groups, I pray. Bring laborers into 
these fields.</p>

<p>Today I pray for Good Samaritan Missions (GSM). This organization 
"provides short-term mission opportunities for students, both undergrad and 
grad, in health sciences (med/dent/vet/opt/nursing, public health, etc.), K-12 
education, and other majors. [Their] program provides an academic as well as 
service component for credit in many of the fifty plus schools with whom [they] 
partner.... Projects are travel intensive and are known for offering students more 
hands-on experience. GSM also provides a student sponsorship program and other 
financial aids. It is [their] mission to not only minister with the poor in 
Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa, but to serve the church at large by 
having a hand in recruiting students for long-term missions in the future." 
Father, we pray that You would bless this outreach ministry and use it to 
further Your Kingdom.</p>

<p>I remember those who work as brickmasons, blockmasons, 
and stonemasons. Give them safety, help them do quality work and may many in 
these fields come to know You. Help Christians in these fields to display the 
love and integrity of Christ and to freely share the good news of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Now help me live for You today, I ask in Jesus&rsquo; Name, 
Amen.</p>
