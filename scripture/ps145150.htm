<p><sup>145:1</sup><sup> </sup>I will exalt you, my God the King; I will praise
your name for ever and ever.&nbsp; <sup>2</sup> Every day I will praise you and
extol your name for ever and ever.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p> <sup>3</sup> Great is the L<span>ORD</span> and most
worthy of praise; his greatness no one can fathom. <sup>4</sup> One generation
will commend your works to another; they will tell of your mighty acts. <sup>5</sup>
They will speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty, and I will meditate on
your wonderful works.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> They will tell of the power of your
awesome works, and I will proclaim your great deeds. <sup>7</sup> They will
celebrate your abundant goodness and joyfully sing of your righteousness. </p>

<p><sup>8</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich
in love. <sup>9</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> is good to all; he has compassion on all he has
made. <sup>10</sup> All you have made will praise you, O L<span>ORD</span>; your saints will
extol you. <sup>11</sup> They will tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak
of your might, <sup>12</sup> so that all men may know of your mighty acts and
the glorious splendor of your kingdom. <sup>13</sup> Your kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations. </p>

<p>The L<span>ORD</span> is faithful to all his promises and loving toward all he has made. <sup>14</sup>
The L<span>ORD</span> upholds all those who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down. <sup>15</sup>
The eyes of all look to you, and you give them their food at the proper time. <sup>16</sup>
You open your hand and satisfy the desires of every living thing. </p>

<p><sup>17</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> is righteous in all his ways and loving toward all he
has made. <sup>18</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> is near to all who call on him, to all who call
on him in truth. <sup>19</sup> He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he
hears their cry and saves them. <sup>20</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> watches over all who love
him, but all the wicked he will destroy.<br>
<br>
<sup>21</sup> My mouth will speak in praise of the L<span>ORD</span>. Let every creature
praise his holy name for ever and ever. </p>

<p><sup>146:1</sup> Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span>, O my soul. <sup>2</sup> I will praise the L<span>ORD</span> all my life;
I will sing praise to my God as long as I live. </p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Do not put your trust in princes, in mortal men, who cannot
save. <sup>4</sup> When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that
very day their plans come to nothing. </p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in
the LORD his God, <sup>6</sup> the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and
everything in them—the L<span>ORD</span>, who remains faithful forever. <sup>7</sup> He
upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The L<span>ORD</span> sets
prisoners free, <sup>8</sup> the L<span>ORD</span> gives sight to the blind, the L<span>ORD</span> lifts
up those who are bowed down, the L<span>ORD</span> loves the righteous. <sup>9</sup> The L<span>ORD</span>
watches over the alien and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he
frustrates the ways of the wicked. </p>

<p><sup>10</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. </p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>

<p><sup>147:1</sup> Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>

<p>How good it is to sing praises to our God,&nbsp; how pleasant and fitting to
praise him!</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the exiles of Israel. <sup>3</sup>
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by
name. <sup>5</sup> Great is our Lord and mighty in power; his understanding has
no limit. <sup>6</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the
ground.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Sing to the L<span>ORD</span> with thanksgiving; make music to our God on the
harp. <sup>8</sup> He covers the sky with clouds; he supplies the earth with
rain and makes grass grow on the hills. <sup>9</sup> He provides food for the
cattle and for the young ravens when they call. </p>

<p><sup>10</sup> His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, nor his
delight in the legs of a man; <sup>11</sup> the L<span>ORD</span> delights in those who fear
him, who put their hope in his unfailing love.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> Extol the L<span>ORD</span>, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion, <sup>13</sup>
for he strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses your people within you. <sup>14</sup>
He grants peace to your borders and satisfies you with the finest of wheat.</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> He sends his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. <sup>16</sup>
He spreads the snow like wool and scatters the frost like ashes. <sup>17</sup>
He hurls down his hail like pebbles. Who can withstand his icy blast? <sup>18</sup>
He sends his word and melts them; he stirs up his breezes, and the waters flow.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> He has revealed his word to Jacob, his laws and decrees to
Israel. <sup>20</sup> He has done this for no other nation; they do not know his
laws.</p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>

<p><sup>148:1</sup> Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span> from the heavens, praise him in the heights above. <sup>2</sup>
Praise him, all his angels, praise him, all his heavenly hosts. <sup>3 </sup>Praise
him, sun and moon, praise him, all you shining stars. <sup>4</sup> Praise him,
you highest heavens and you waters above the skies. <sup>5</sup> Let them praise
the name of the L<span>ORD</span>, for he commanded and they were created. <sup>6</sup> He
set them in place for ever and ever; he gave a decree that will never pass away.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Praise the L<span>ORD</span> from the earth, you great sea creatures and all
ocean depths, <sup>8</sup> lightning and hail, snow and clouds, stormy winds
that do his bidding, <sup>9</sup> you mountains and all hills, fruit trees and
all cedars, <sup>10</sup> wild animals and all cattle, small creatures and
flying birds, <sup>11</sup> kings of the earth and all nations, you princes and
all rulers on earth, <sup>12</sup> young men and maidens, old men and children.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Let them praise the name of the L<span>ORD</span>, for his name alone is
exalted; his splendor is above the earth and the heavens. <sup>14</sup> He has
raised up for his people a horn,<sup> </sup>the
praise of all his saints, of Israel, the people close to his heart. </p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.
</p>

<p><sup>149:1</sup> Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.
</p>

<p>Sing to the L<span>ORD</span> a new song, his praise in the assembly of the saints.
</p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the people of Zion be
glad in their King. <sup>3</sup> Let them praise his name with dancing and make
music to him with tambourine and harp. <sup>4</sup> For the L<span>ORD</span> takes delight
in his people; he crowns the humble with salvation. <sup>5</sup> Let the saints
rejoice in this honor and sing for joy on their beds.
</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> May the praise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged
sword in their hands, <sup>7</sup> to inflict vengeance on the nations and
punishment on the peoples, <sup>8</sup> to bind their kings with fetters, their
nobles with shackles of iron, <sup>9</sup> to carry out the sentence written
against them. This is the glory of all his saints.
</p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.
</p>

<p><sup>150:1</sup> Praise the L<span>ORD</span>. Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in
his mighty heavens. <sup>2</sup> Praise him for his acts of power; praise him
for his surpassing greatness. <sup>3</sup> Praise him with the sounding of the
trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre, <sup>4</sup> praise him with
tambourine and dancing, praise him with the strings and flute, <sup>5</sup>
praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him with resounding cymbals.
</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> Let everything that has breath praise the L<span>ORD</span>.
</p>

<p>Praise the L<span>ORD</span>.
