<p>Great God,</p>
<p>You are the God Who sees. When Hagar was cast away into 
the dessert with her son, Ishmael, and they were ready to die of thirst, you 
showed them a source of water. Hagar praised You for caring for her as “the God 
Who really sees.” The gods of the people are idols, but You, O Lord, are Maker 
of heaven and earth. You do see because You are real. As a matter of fact, 
there are no barriers that block Your vision from all that is everywhere. You 
see it all. I praise You because of Who You are.</p>
<p>Lord, sometimes I wonder if You see my plight or know my 
struggles. There are times I feel alone as though it were just me and my 
shadow. But the truth is that I am never alone. Even if I walk through the 
valley of the shadow of death, Your rod and staff comfort me. Help me to trust 
Your Word, that You do see, over my feelings that vacillate with the barometer.</p>
<p>Father, help me to plan before I act. Remind me that I 
have two ears but only one mouth, so help me to be a good listener. Keep me 
from interrupting others or from jumping to conclusions. Help me to contribute 
to conversations and to be forthcoming, but help me not to hijack them and grab 
all the attention for myself.</p>
<p>Your Word tells me that if I confess my sins, You are 
faithful and&nbsp;just to forgive me those sins, and You will purify me from 
all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 John 1:9</b>). I accept responsibility for my 
sins and freely 
bring them as Your Spirit brings to my mind now: __________.</p>
<p>I pray for the nation of Haiti. Thank You for the great 
response to the Gospel: over 22% of the population claim to be born-again 
evangelical Christians! And many of the believers are taking a firm stand for 
you. Even so, Satan has a strong grip on so many because of voodoo. Bind the 
evil one, and may Your Spirit overpower the enemies’ attempts to keep the people 
in bondage. Help the church develop good strong leaders and to better reach the 
less reached groups.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for the ministry of the Navigators whose 
staff helps “Christ’s followers 'navigate' spiritually, coming alongside to 
support them as they search the Word of God to chart the course of their lives. 
The hallmarks of [this] ministry are one-to-one relationships and small-group 
studies focused on discipleship.” Thank You for their work among “college 
campuses, military bases, inner cities, prisons and youth camps.” Give them 
fruit for their labor, provide for them, and empower them by their Spirit.</p>
<p>We remember the world’s veterinarians. Many of them work 
with livestock and farm animals while some work with pets. But whatever their 
specialty, help them to do their work well. May those who know You exemplify 
Your character and freely share their faith with both clients and other vets. 
May many come to know You.</p>
<p>Work in my life and heart today, I ask in Jesus’ Name, 
Amen. </p>
