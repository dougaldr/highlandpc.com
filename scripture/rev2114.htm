<p><sup>1</sup> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven
and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any&nbsp; sea.&nbsp;
<sup>2</sup>
I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> And I
heard a loud voice from the throne saying , &quot;Now the dwelling of God is in
them.&nbsp; They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their
God.&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> He will wipe every tear from their eyes.&nbsp; There will be no more
death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed
away.&quot;</p>
