<p><sup>2</sup> After Moses had sent away his 
wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her
<sup>3</sup> and her two sons. One son was named 
Gershom, for Moses said, &quot;I have become an alien in a foreign land&quot;;
<sup>4</sup> and the other was named Eliezer,
for he said, &quot;My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of 
Pharaoh.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>5</sup> Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, 
together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was 
camped near the mountain of God. <sup>6</sup> 
Jethro had sent word to him, &quot;I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you 
with your wife and her two sons.&quot; </p>
