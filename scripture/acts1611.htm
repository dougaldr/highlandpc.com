<p><sup>6</sup> So when they met together, they asked him, 
“Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?” </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> He said to them: “It is not for you to know 
the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
<sup>8</sup> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit 
comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and 
Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.” </p>
<p><sup>9</sup> After he said this, he was taken up before 
their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. </p>
<p><sup>10</sup> They were looking intently up into the sky 
as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
<sup>11</sup> “Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand 
here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into 
heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.” </p>
