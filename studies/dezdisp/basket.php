	<p>Where did she get the idea of the basket?</p>
	<p>Many scholars have been impressed by a similar story 
	about another Semite, Sargon of Akkad from the second half of the third 
	millennium B.C. He, too, was placed in a basket of rushes coated with pitch 
	and cast on a river only to be found by Akki the gardener who rescued him 
	and raised him as his son.</p>

	<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>It seems God allows history to run its 
	course. But His unusual interventions demonstrate that He was never absent 
	in the first place.</u></p>
	<li><p><b>The People Involved</b></li>.<ol type=A><li><p>Who was the Pharaoh who enslaved Israel?</p></li>
		<ol type=1><li><p>Possibly the King of the 
		new 13<sup>th</sup> dynasty (family) who came to power about the time 
		Joseph died.</li>
		<li><p>It is probably much 
		later, after the <b>name </b>of Joseph had been forgotten and his great 
		achievements perhaps attributed to Imhotep. This is supported by 
		Stephen's sermon in <b>Acts 17:18</b>, &quot;Then another king, who knew nothing of 
		Joseph, became ruler of Egypt.&quot;</span></li>
		<li><p>The population of Israel 
		had to be <b>large</b> and the element of fear of allying with Egypt's 
		enemies was the primary motivation.</span></li>
		<li><p>These enemies could have 
		been either the <b>Hyksos,</b> Canaanite &amp; Phoenician people who 
		eventually controlled the northern 2/3 of Egypt, </span></li>
		<li><p>Or if later, the Hyksos Pharaohs were afraid that the Israelite might align themselves 
		with the southern part of the Kingdom, controlled by <b>Egyptians</b>,</li>
		<li><p>Or it could be <b>after
		</b>the Egyptians gained control of all Egypt, and they were afraid that 
		the Hyksos would regain power (<b>best guess</b>); the Pharaoh would be 
		Ahmose I.</span></li>
	</ol>
	<p><img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/ahmosei.jpg" width="189" height="337"></p>
	<li><p>Who was the 
	Evil king who ordered infanticide?</li>
	<p><img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/evilking.gif" width="191" height="475"></p>
	<li><p>Who was the 
	Princess?</li>
	<p><img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/princess.jpg" width="258" height="313"></p>
	<p>Perhaps a young woman named Nefure, whose name was 
	later changed to Hatshepsut when she became the second and perhaps last 
	female Pharaoh in Egyptian history.</p>
	<p>We'll discuss her more next week.</p>
	<li><p>Why did she deliver Moses?</li>
	<p><b>Hebrews 11:23</b>, &quot;By faith Moses' parents hid him for 
	three months after he was born, because they saw <b>he was no ordinary child</b>, 
	and they were not afraid of the king's edict.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>Acts 7:20-21</b>, &quot;At that time Moses was born, and <b>he 
	was no ordinary child.</b><sup> </sup>For three months he was cared for in 
	his father's house. When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him 
	and brought him up as her own son.&quot;</p>
	<p>A legend that Amram (Moses' dad) had a prophetic dream 
	(like Joseph in the NT).</p>
	<p>&quot;James Baikie observes (53) that one little fragment of 
	great importance has been preserved, an admission to the effect that she had 
	a particular liking for foreigners&quot; --Arthur Custance</p></ol>
	<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>It seems God allows history to run its 
	course. But His unusual interventions demonstrate that He was never absent 
	in the first place.</u></p>
	<li><p><b>Practical Consideration.</b><ol type=A><li><p>Is it right to lie to save a life?</li>
	<ol type=1><li><p>The midwives lied to 
		Pharaoh and made up a story about how Hebrew women gave birth.</li>
		<li><p>Human life issues are 
		big issues today. We have issues like abortion, persecution of 
		believers or other persecuted groups....We have end of life issues....complex</li>
		<li><p>All sorts of ethical dilemmas....</li>
		<li><p>WWII--Corrie Ten Boom 
		&amp; family...lied to save lives of Jews...right or wrong?</li>
		<li><p>David feigned madness....</li>
	</ol>
	<li><p>The Influence of Maternal Instinct</li>.<ol type=1><li><p>Maternal instinct made Moses' mother hide her boy 
		at the risk of her life.</li>
		<li><p>Maternal instinct made the princess tell her servants to retrieve 
		the baby from the water....</li>
		<li><p>Maternal instinct needs to be celebrated in a day when mothers 
		abort, abuse, and neglect their children, expecting the schools and 
		society to rear them....</li>
	</ol>
	<li><p>Are foreigners as human as we?</li>
	<ol type=1><li><p>If Hatshepsut was in fact Moses step-mother, it 
		seems that she tried to make up for the evil infanticide that her 
		father, Thutmose I instituted....She loved foreigners.</li>
		<li><p>But some Christians so value the land of their 
		birth that they forget there is a world of lost people out there who 
		need the Gospel of Jesus Christ...which is why it is crucial for 
		churches to support long-term career missionaries....</li>
	</ol>
	<li><p>God Gets the job done in unusual ways.</li><ol type=1>
	<li><p>Moses, a baby floating in a basket in a crocodile-infested river.</li>
	<li><p>Baby Jesus, hunted down by Herod, escapes into Egypt</li>
	<p><b>Matthew 2:14-15</b>, &quot;When he arose, he took the young 
	child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt: And was there until 
	the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord 
	by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.&quot;</li>
	<li><p>Both grow up and show their strength.</li>
	<li><p>The Law came through Moses, Grace and Truth through 
	Jesus Christ.</li>
	<li><p>Jesus redeemed mankind in a most unlikely way....</li></ol></ol>
	<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>It seems God allows history to run its 
	course. But His unusual interventions demonstrate that He was never absent 
	in the first place.</u></p>
	<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
	<p>What about you? Has God delivered you through the 
	death of Jesus Christ?
	<p>Jesus died for you, suffered for you, rose for you 
	so that God could forgive you.
	<p>Have you invited Him into your life to forgive your 
	sins and be your Savior?
	<p>If not, would you like to do that right now?
