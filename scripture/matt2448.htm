<p><sup>4</sup> Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives 
you. <sup>5</sup> For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I 
am the Christ,’ 
and will deceive many. <sup>6</sup> You will hear of wars and 
rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, 
but the end is still to come. <sup>7</sup> Nation will rise 
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and 
earthquakes in various places. <sup>8</sup> All these are the 
beginning of birth pains.” </p>
