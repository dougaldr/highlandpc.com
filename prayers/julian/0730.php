<p>God of the Years,</p>
<p>Although we age and pass away from this life like the 
grass, You go on unscathed by time. Yet You are the Ancient of Days. Your 
eternal nature compliments Your infinite wisdom. We tend to think of gray or 
white hair as a sign of both age and the accumulated wisdom of age. But You 
have always had all wisdom and knowledge. When Daniel saw a vision of You, He 
wrote, &quot;As I looked, thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his 
seat. His clothing was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like 
wool. His throne was flaming with fire and its wheels were all ablaze&quot; (<b>Daniel 
7:9</b>). I praise You as the &quot;all wise One.&quot; Thank You for sharing some of Your 
wisdom in Your Word.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You 
today. They are: __________.</p>
<p>First John says that if I confess my sins, You are faithful 
and&nbsp;just to forgive me those sins, and You will purify me from 
all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 John 1:9</b>). I confess the sins I am aware of now and I 
ask Your Spirit to search my heart (<i>Pause to admit them to God.</i>).</p>
<p>Help me to do my part by volunteering to serve or 
continuing to serve in a Bible-believing, Bible-teaching church. May I set my 
roots down deeply and to attend every week I am able to do so.</p>
<p>Today I pray for the 92 islands that make up the African 
nation of Seychelles. Thank You for the religious freedom that prevails here 
and thank You that about 5.3% claim to be born-again evangelicals. Forty years 
ago, the percentage of evangelicals was close to zero, so thank You, Lord, that 
You are working by Your Spirit. Send laborers to reach the less-reached people 
and help Christian broadcasting to be able to air the Gospel in more languages. 
This is a very immoral and superstitious nation: help those who come to know You 
to put these sinful ways behind them. May Your Spirit draw many more to 
Yourself; please double the church over the next five years for Your glory.</p>
<p>Lord, please bless Utah Partnerships for Christ. &quot;UPFC's 
vision is to train college students to effectively reach the ever growing Mormon 
population around the world. [They] train students to speak the truth in love 
and create opportunities for relationship building evangelism. [Their] target is 
Utah since 70% of all Utahans are Mormon. [They] spend time on college campuses 
like Brigham Young University and Temple Square where Mormons are typically 
open to discussion about Christ. [They] also reach out to the lost on the Ute 
Indian Reservation and assist with work projects helping local churches and 
Christian ministries. These efforts along with helping facilitate Christian 
concerts serves to encourage and evangelize the state of Utah,...a forgotten 
mission field.&quot;</p>
<p>Provide for them, prosper their efforts and draw many to 
Yourself by the regenerating power of Your Spirit, I ask.</p>
<p>Help me to bear testimony to the true Gospel of Jesus 
Christ, I pray in His Name, Amen.</p>
