<p><sup>38</sup>&nbsp;&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and
tooth for tooth.'&nbsp; <sup>39</sup> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.&nbsp;
If
someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.&nbsp; <sup>40</sup>
And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as
well.&nbsp; <sup>41</sup> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.&nbsp;
<sup>42</sup> Give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who
wants to borrow from you.</p>

<p><sup>43</sup> &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and
hate your enemy.'&nbsp; <sup>44</sup> But I tell you : Love your enemies and pray for
those who persecute you, <sup>45</sup> that you may be sons of your father in
heaven.&nbsp; He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on
the righteous and the unrighteous.&nbsp; <sup>46</sup> If you love those who love you,
what reward will you get?&nbsp; Are not even the tax collectors doing that?&nbsp;
<sup>47</sup>
And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others?&nbsp; Do not
even pagans do that?&nbsp; <sup>48</sup> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly
Father is perfect.</p>
