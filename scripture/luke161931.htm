<p><sup>19</sup> There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen
and lived in luxury every day.&nbsp; <sup>20</sup> At his gate was laid a beggar named
Lazarus, covered with sores <sup>21</sup> and longing to eat what fell from the
rich man's table.&nbsp; Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>

<p><sup>22</sup> The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him
to Abraham's side.&nbsp; The rich man also died and was buried.&nbsp; <sup>23</sup> In hell,
where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by
his side.&nbsp; <sup>24</sup> So he called to him, &quot;Father Abraham, have pity on
me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue,
because&nbsp; I am an agony in this fire.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>25</sup> But Abraham replied, &quot;Son, remember hat in your lifetime
you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is
comforted here and you are in agony.&nbsp; <sup>26</sup> And besides all this, between
us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here
to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> He answered, &quot;Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my
father's house, <sup>28</sup> for I have five brothers.&nbsp; Let him warn them, so
that they will not also come to this place of torment.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>29</sup> Abraham replied, &quot;They have Moses and the Prophets; let
them listen to them.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>30</sup> &quot;No, father Abraham,&quot; he said, &quot;but if someone
from the dead goes to them, they will repent.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>31</sup> He said to him, &quot;If they do not listen to Moses and the
Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.&quot;</p>
