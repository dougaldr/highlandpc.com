<br>February 14

<p>Great God,</p>
<p>Thank You for your love, a love that is pure, enduring, and 
deep. Thank You that, in Christ, nothing can separate me from Your love. Thank 
You that You are a social God. As Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, each of the 
Persons of the Trinity seek to glorify one another. And it was through a 
conversation between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit that the universe was 
created as You said, &quot;Let us....&quot;</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that I too need others to be happy and 
fulfilled. Sometimes I feel lonely and alone; help me not to cower in a corner, 
but help me to jump into my church, neighborhood, and community. You made me 
social, just as You are social. Help me nurture that part of my being and not 
stifle it in fear.</p>
<p>Help me remember that our church is a body, and that I have 
a part to play. Help me to be forbearing (to put up with a lot), to confront 
when necessary, and not to be touchy. Help me maintain a realistic view about 
human nature—even among the regenerate—so that I do not hold false 
expectations that will be frustrated.</p>
<p>God, Your Word tells me to ask for wisdom when I need it. 
I ask You to enlighten my mind, and, like the wise person of Proverbs, help me 
to seek, crave, and pursue wisdom.</p>
<p>Dear Lord, today I pray for the nation of Burundi. Although 
many in this nation claim to be born-again, the hatred between the Tutsi and 
Hutu peoples has resulted in massive murder and devastation. Help the 
evangelical church to be a community of reconciliation. Please restart the 
leadership training centers, and help the people forgive. Be especially 
gracious to all the orphans who saw their parents slaughtered simply because 
they belonged to the wrong tribe. Please, Lord, bring healing.</p>
<p>I remember the ministry of Jews for Jesus as they take the 
good news of Yeshua the Messiah to the Jewish people around the world. May Your 
Spirit empower the workers, help them to walk with You and to get along with one 
another, and provide for them in every way. Give them great fruit for their 
labor as they reach Your special nation.</p>
<p>Today I also pray for our public libraries and librarians. 
Thank You that, in our nation, we may expand our minds freely. We know that 
many philosophies and teachings are contrary to Your Word, so help us to study 
that we might have answers and offer alternatives that please You. May more and 
more librarians and administrators come to know You.</p>
<p>Help me look for 
You working among those I rub shoulders with today, and help me walk through the 
doors You open, I pray, in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
