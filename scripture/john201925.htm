<p><sup>19</sup> On the evening of that first day of the week, 
when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, 
Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”
<p><sup>20</sup> After he said this, he showed them his hands and 
side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</p>   
<p><sup>21</sup> Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As 
the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” <sup>22</sup> And 
with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
<sup>23</sup> If you forgive anyone his sins, they are 
forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.” </p>
<p><sup>24</sup> Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the 
Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. <sup>25</sup> So 
the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” 
<p>But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my 
finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe 
it.” </p>
