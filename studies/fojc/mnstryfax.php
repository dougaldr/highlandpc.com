<ol type=I><li><b>Timeline</b>
<p>Although the dates and duration of Christ’s ministry are 
matters of debate, I endorse the conclusions of Harold Hoehner’s book, <u>
Chronological Aspects in the Life of Christ</u>. His “ministry” would have been 
about 3&#189; years. The Bible does NOT say Christ was 30 when He began preaching, 
but ABOUT 30; so Luke did not know his exact age. Hoehner would place him at 
33 or 34.</p>
