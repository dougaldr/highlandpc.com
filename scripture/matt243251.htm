<p><sup>32</sup> “Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: 
As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is 
near. <sup>33</sup> Even so, when you see all these things, you 
know that it is 
near, right at the door. <sup>34</sup> I tell you the truth, 
this generation 
will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 
<sup>35</sup> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words 
will never pass away.” </p>
<p><sup>36</sup> “No one knows about that day or hour, not even 
the angels in heaven, nor the Son, 
but only the Father.  <sup>37</sup> As it was in the days of 
Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <sup>38</sup> For 
in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and 
giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <sup>39</sup> and they 
knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and 
took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
<sup>40</sup> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken 
and the other left. <sup>41</sup> Two women will be grinding 
with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.”</p>   
<p><sup>42</sup> “Therefore keep watch, because you do not 
know on what day your Lord will come. <sup>43</sup> But 
understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the 
thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be 
broken into. <sup>44</sup> So you also must be ready, because 
the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.” </p>
<p><sup>45</sup> “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, 
whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them 
their food at the proper time? <sup>46</sup> It will be good 
for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
<sup>47</sup> I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge 
of all his possessions. <sup>48</sup> But suppose that servant 
is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is staying away a long time,’
<sup>49</sup> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants 
and to eat and drink with drunkards. <sup>50</sup> The master 
of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he 
is not aware of. <sup>51</sup> He will cut him to pieces and 
assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing 
of teeth.” </p>
