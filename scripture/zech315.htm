<body class="popup">

<p><sup>1</sup> Then he showed me Joshua  
the high priest standing before the angel of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, and Satan  
standing at his right side to accuse him. <sup>2</sup> 
The L<span class="sm">ORD</span> said to Satan, &quot;The L<span class="sm">ORD</span> rebuke you, Satan! The L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, who has chosen 
Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire?&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> Now Joshua was dressed in 
filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. 
<sup>4</sup> The angel said to those who were standing before him, &quot;Take off his 
filthy clothes.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he said to Joshua, &quot;See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put 
rich garments on you.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Then I said, &quot;Put a clean 
turban on his head.&quot; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him, 
while the angel of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> stood by. </p>
