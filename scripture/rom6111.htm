<p><sup>1</sup> What shall we say then?&nbsp; Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?&nbsp;
<sup>2</sup> By no means!&nbsp; We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?&nbsp;
<sup>3</sup> Or don't you
know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his
death?&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death
in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, we too may live a new life.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will
certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> For we know
that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done
away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin&#151; <sup>7</sup> because
anyone who has died has been freed from sin.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live
with him.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead,
he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> The
death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to
God.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God
in Christ Jesus.</p>
