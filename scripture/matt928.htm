<p><sup>2</sup> Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a 
mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, son; 
your sins are forgiven.”</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> At this, some of the teachers of the law 
said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!” </p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do 
you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts? <sup>5</sup> Which 
is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
<sup>6</sup> But so that you may know that the Son of Man has 
authority on earth to forgive sins....” Then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, 
take your mat and go home.” <sup>7</sup> And the man got up and 
went home. <sup>8</sup> When the crowd saw this, they were 
filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to men.</p>
