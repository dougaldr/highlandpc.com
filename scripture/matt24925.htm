<p><sup>9</sup> “Then you will be handed over to be 
persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
<sup>10</sup> At that time many will turn away from the faith 
and will betray and hate each other, <sup>11</sup> and many 
false prophets will appear and deceive many people. <sup>12</sup> Because 
of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,
<sup>13</sup> but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
<sup>14</sup> And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached 
in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”
</p>
<p><sup>15</sup> “So when you see standing in the holy place 
‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ 
spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader understand—
<sup>16</sup> then let those who are in Judea flee to the 
mountains. <sup>17</sup> Let no one on the roof of his house go 
down to take anything out of the house. <sup>18</sup> Let no 
one in the field go back to get his cloak. <sup>19</sup> How 
dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
<sup>20</sup> Pray that your flight will not take place in 
winter or on the Sabbath. <sup>21</sup> For then there will be 
great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to 
be equaled again. <sup>22</sup> If those days had not been cut 
short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be 
shortened. <sup>23</sup> At that time if anyone says to you, 
‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘There he is!’ do not believe it.
<sup>24</sup> For false Christs and false prophets will appear 
and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect—if that were 
possible. <sup>25</sup> See, I have told you ahead of time.” </p>
