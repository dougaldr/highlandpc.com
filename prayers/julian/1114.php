<p>Great God,</p>
<p>You are exalted above Your creation. You are not part of creation even though 
You are present everywhere. The universe had a beginning: You have always been. 
The universe is impersonal, You are Personal. You are Father, Son and Holy 
Spirit. Created things are impersonal except for the personal created beings: 
angels (both holy and fallen) and human beings. You are spiritual; much of the 
universe is physical. The laws of physics have no bearing upon You, but the 
universe would destruct were it not for those laws You established.</p>
<p>Lord, I know that the natural man—the person without Christ who has never 
been born again—that person cannot understand the things of the Spirit because 
they are foolishness to him or her. Although such persons may be religious, 
their eyes are not open until You, O Lord, open them. I recognize that I cannot 
reason someone into the Kingdom of God, nor can I persuade him or her against 
his or her will. But, Lord, You can use me in the process if Your Spirit is 
opening their eyes and helping them to accept spiritual truth. So I want to be 
used of You, but help me to realize that ultimately without You, I can do 
nothing.</p>
<p>God, please send angels to watch over me and my loved ones. Keep us from harm 
and evil of every kind, night and day, over the course of our lives.</p>
<p>Help those within my physical and spiritual family to love one another. 
Sometimes this can be a tall order; not everyone is necessarily easy to love and 
we love different people in different ways according to who they are and how 
they act. So give me both love and wisdom, both kindness and truth. Help me to 
know when to be firm and when to be gracious. Make me neither a doormat nor 
hardhearted.</p>
<p>I pray for church board leaders, officers and teachers. If any do not know 
You, may they become born-again. Help them to be true to the Bible and to put 
Your Word over their own personal agendas. Help them to have genuine integrity, 
Biblical convictions, love, wisdom and courage. Help them be more concerned 
about pleasing You than advancing their agendas; may they seek harmony when 
reasonable within the congregation.</p>
<p>Today I remember the African nation of Zambia with its 11 
million people. Lord, in recent years, many have come to know You. Over 25 percent 
of the population claims to be born again and evangelical. The president 
is an outspoken Christian. Yet, Lord, the economy is in a mess and the AIDS 
epidemic is widespread. This also puts a lot of strain on pastors as they seek 
to evangelize those with AIDS, minister to their families, visit the sick and 
dying and bury the dead. Consoling and helping the families is a long term 
task. O Father, help the people of Zambia to come to know You, to embrace 
Christian morality and to have compassion upon those who are suffering from 
this dreaded disease, I ask. May the church continue to mature and may it 
continue to grow.</p>
<p>I offer myself up to You as Your servant today, in Jesus’ 
Name, Amen.</p>
