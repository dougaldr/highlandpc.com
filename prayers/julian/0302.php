<br>March 2

<p>All-Powerful One,</p>
<p>Thank You that You are a Mighty Warrior 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex153.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 15:3</a>). You 
are not the fearful passive god that many believe in: You are the God Who 
fights, and Who fights aggressively. Just as You fought for Israel as they 
broke free of Egyptian bondage, so You have fought for our salvation. When the 
Savior prayed in Gethsemane the night before His crucifixion, He sweat drops of 
blood as He battled to submit His will to Yours. By His sacrificial death on 
the cross and His resurrection, He provided the basis to defeat Satan and all 
the forces of evil and darkness. He arose a Victor and Conqueror. You fight 
for us in ways we do not even recognize.</p>
<p>Today I praise You that the Holy Spirit has sealed me for 
the day of redemption. I bear the royal seal of the King of Kings, and none 
dare open the seal but He. I am Yours, Lord, bought with the blood of Jesus 
Christ. I am not my own.</p>
<p>But, Lord, sometimes I live as though I were my own. I 
steer my own course and leave You out of the equation completely, or relegate 
You to second or third place. Oh, Father, help me to resist this and other 
temptations, temptations I face every day, temptations that do not even register 
as temptations. You know it is difficult for me to live for You. But then I 
again remember that You are the Warrior God, fighting for me!</p>
<p>Help me to be a person of hope. Sometimes life seems 
mundane and routine. Some of the people I have to deal with are unpleasant or 
unimaginative. Sometimes my own personality defects make me uninviting! So 
help me, Lord, to be patient with others, but to humble myself and check my own 
arrogance or rudeness.</p>
<p>Today I pray for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 
formerly known as Zaire. This nation is separate from but adjoining Congo. 
The DRC has suffered from war after war and oppression from without and from 
within. Thank You that now the government recognizes religious freedom. Thank 
you for that over 19% of the population claims to be born-again. There is a lot 
of work to be done: reaching the severely despised Pygmy peoples, training lay 
leaders, and addressing tribal and &quot;warlord&quot; tensions. There are many groups 
that need Bible translation. I pray that the church would become stronger, the 
leaders eager for training, and that the environment would be conducive for 
evangelism, discipleship, and spiritual maturity. May Your church shine in the DRC, Lord!</p>
<p>I remember the SGA, the Slavic Gospel Association. &quot;With 
90 percent of the thousands of towns and villages in the lands of Russia still 
waiting for their first Bible-preaching church, it's no surprise that tens of 
millions of struggling Russians have yet to hear the life-changing Gospel of 
Jesus Christ.&quot; Thank You for SGA's ministry of working with the indigenous 
church there, planting churches, training leaders, and using media to reach lost 
people in not only Russia but other nations of the former Soviet Union. Help 
the missionaries to work in harmony with one another and the leaders of the 
individual churches; may Your Spirit empower them and grant them a great 
harvest. Provide for the physical and spiritual needs of the missionaries and 
those with whom they work.</p>
<p>I pray for childcare workers everywhere. Lord, keep our 
children safe and treated compassionately; help those in the childcare field to 
take pride in their task, and give them a love and protective spirit for the 
children they supervise. May many childcare workers come to know You, and may 
they share their faith, not only with the children, but also with parents.</p>
<p>I commit my day to You, in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
