<p><sup>1</sup> Who has believed our message <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to whom has the arm of the L<span>ORD</span> been revealed? </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>2</sup> He grew up before him like a 
tender shoot, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and like a root out of dry ground. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> He was despised and rejected by 
men, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like one from whom men hide their faces <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Surely he took up our 
infirmities <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and carried our sorrows, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet we considered him stricken by God, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smitten by him, and afflicted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> But he was pierced for our 
transgressions, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was crushed for our iniquities; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and by his wounds we are healed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> We all, like sheep, have gone 
astray, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each of us has turned to his own way; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the L<span>ORD</span> has laid on him <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the iniquity of us all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> He was oppressed and afflicted,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet he did not open his mouth; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so he did not open his mouth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> By oppression  
and judgment he was taken away. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And who can speak of his descendants? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he was cut off from the land of the living; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> He was assigned a grave with 
the wicked, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and with the rich in his death, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though he had done no violence, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor was any deceit in his mouth. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> Yet it was the L<span>ORD</span>'s will to 
crush him and cause him to suffer, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and though the L<span>ORD</span> makes  
his life a guilt offering, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he will see his offspring and prolong his days, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the will of the L<span>ORD</span> will prosper in his hand. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> After the suffering of his 
soul, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he will see the light of life  
and be satisfied; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by his knowledge 
my righteous servant will justify many, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he will bear their iniquities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> Therefore I will give him a 
portion among the great,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he will divide the spoils with the strong,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because he poured out his life unto death, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and was numbered with the transgressors. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For he bore the sin of many, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and made intercession for the transgressors.</p>
