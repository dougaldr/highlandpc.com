<p>Our Father,

<p>
The fact we call you Father reminds us of the blessing family relationships
could be. You love families. You instituted
marriage, and you designed
mankind to find a level of security, love, support, and blessing within
families. Yet Lord, the reality is that sin has devastated our
relationships. Rather than incubators for love and security,
many of our
nation's families are hotbeds for strife, abuse, and chaos. Behind our
society's escalation of crime, drugs, and poverty is a decrease in family
commitment and declining participation in our community life. Renew our
determination to make our families work; help us to check reclusive
tendencies in ourselves and become participators in our world.

<p>
Oh Father, stem the scourge of divorce. Help married couples to
determine
to work out their differences, as difficult as that may seem. Help each
marriage partner to focus upon his or her failings, not the disappointments
found in a spouse. Keep married individuals from coveting another
person
or dreaming of greener pastures. Bring a deep sense of guilt to those
whose
minds wander, for this is where so much sin begins.

<p>
Give our children intact families that they might be able to also have
healthy marriages and strong moral compasses. May we propagate relational
success, not failure. Help parents to thoughtfully and carefully
direct
their children with initiative, not mindlessly allowing them to follow just
any trend. Help parents talk to their children, play with
their children,
and offer quality and quantity of time. May parents shape
their children'
s values, not the television, Hollywood, or music celebrities. May homes
become the moral and spiritual centers You intend them to be.

<p>Minister grace to those innocent victims, our children, who—through no
fault of their own—find themselves victims of broken relationships.&nbsp;
Break
away the deceptive rationalizing that says children are resilient, and
instead help adults to tenderly shelter their young ones from situations
that will forever scar their innermost being. Help the agencies that
minister to such children.

<p>
Thank you for the government, civic, and faith-based organizations that
address matters like poverty, education, abuse, life-skills, as well
agencies addressing issues of moral and religious fiber. We ask your
blessing not only upon organizations like the Kokomo Rescue Mission, Nesting
Doves, and Birthright, but also upon the numerous humanitarian charities
and organizations that grace our community. Their task seem insurmountable.

<p>
One service that we have learned to appreciate in a greater way is our Fire
Department. September 11th has changed our perspective. We thank you
for
the many lives saved, the many buildings preserved, and the new respect
Americans have for fire fighters as true heroes. Please keep them safe.&nbsp;
Thank you for all those who look out for others, whose world does not end
with themselves or their families.

<p>
Help all of us to be involved in our communities, to be good neighbors and
true participants in our society. Help us to do our civic duty, to
participate in clubs, organizations, churches, and causes. May we not
merely live in Kokomo or Howard County or the region, but may we be active
participators in our society, truly becoming the salt of the earth.

<p>
Father, our families and communities have fallen on hard times. Rescue us,
we pray. Reach down and pull us from the mire.

<p>
We ask in Jesus' Name, Amen.
