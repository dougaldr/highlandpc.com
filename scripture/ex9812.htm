<p><sup>8</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses and 
Aaron, &quot;Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air 
in the presence of Pharaoh. <sup>9</sup> It will 
become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break 
out on men and animals throughout the land.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> So they took soot from a 
furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering 
boils broke out on men and animals. <sup>11</sup> 
The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on 
them and on all the Egyptians. <sup>12</sup> But 
the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, 
just as the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had said to Moses.</p>
