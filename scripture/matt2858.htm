<p><sup>5</sup> The angel said to the women, “Do not be 
afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
<sup>6</sup> He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. 
Come and see the place where he lay. <sup>7</sup> Then go 
quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead 
of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.” </p>
<p><sup>8</sup> So the women hurried away from the tomb, 
afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. </p>
