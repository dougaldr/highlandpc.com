<br>Consulting God
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Have you ever tried to surprise someone and then discovered that the surprise
was received as anything but positive? Perhaps you purchased an ice cream cone
for a friend, and then found out your chum detests ice cream. You picked
up a new book for a relative to find out he just finished reading his own copy.<br>
<br>
When I counsel couples in preparation for marriage, I always advise them to
never, ever make a major purchase without consulting their spouse first. I
wonder how many husbands, for example, surprise their wives with a new car, only
to create strife and financial tension later. Not good.<br>
<br>
The same concept is true with our relationship to the Lord: He wants to be
consulted&#151;first! <b>Isaiah 30:1</b> reads, &quot;'Woe to the obstinate children,'
declares the L<span class="footer">ORD</span>, 'to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an
alliance, but not by my Spirit....'&quot; In the book of Joshua, the children of
Israel made an alliance with the Gibeonites&#151;an alliance they should not have
made. The Gibeonites pretended to have come from a far away country, and the
Israelites, using mere reason, signed a treaty with them. According to <b> Joshua
9:14</b>, &quot;The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of
the L<span class="footer">ORD</span>.&quot; They had been duped because they followed mere logic and never
asked God.<br>
<br>
I have known many Christians, claiming to be followers of Christ, soldiers in
his army, who neglect to check in with headquarters for orders. Like
mercenaries, they simply order their lives based on their own desires. The
thought of waiting upon God for direction never enters their minds. If you
belong to Christ, you are not your own. You no longer have a right to make your
own decisions or order your own life. If he is your Master, then you are his
servant.<br>
<br>
Although this may sound bold, I have seen marriages crumble, children turn out
poorly, and the spiritual depth of formerly strong believers take a nose dive
because, I believe, they did not bother to consult God. They moved, married,
switched churches/careers, or made major decisions on their own without
consulting headquarters. They went solo, AWOL, did not acquire orders.<br>
<br>
Our walks with God, our marriages, and our families are very fragile. In some
instances, they survive only if we submit to the Lord's will. If we follow the
Lord fully, he places us in environments that accomplish his purposes for us.&nbsp;
If
we choose to enter an environment at our own bidding, we penetrate beyond God's
protective hedge and enter the danger zone. A tank does well on land but will
sink in the ocean. A submarine does great in the ocean but will wallow on land.&nbsp;
We may not know whether we are tanks or submarines, but the Commander-in-Chief
knows.<br>
<br>
If we move to a different town, church, neighborhood, switch careers, or marry
without first consulting God, we are placing ourselves in spiritual danger. The
best place to be, whether in Kokomo or the jungles of Africa, is right where God
wants us to be. But when we don't consult him, when we make our own decisions,
we are denying his lordship over us. He is no longer the Commander, we set our
own destiny. We do so at our own hazard.<br>
<br>
In many instances, the Lord wants us to make our own choices. Just as
headquarters leaves many of the mundane decisions to the trooper, I do not
believe we need to consult God about every detail of life. I don't think God
cares which pair of socks I put on today. It's not wrong to ask him, just
unnecessary, in my view. But when it comes to our relationships and major or
even medium decisions, how dare we not consult our Commander-in-Chief!<br>
<br>
Don't just take a new job. Pray about it. Get counsel from the godly.&nbsp;
Consider
how it will affect your spiritual life and relationships. Lay it out before God.
Ask him to stop you if you are erring. Don't just marry someone you find
attractive: use the Scriptural criteria (marrying a believer, etc.), consult
godly and wise friends, lay it before the Lord. Don't just buy a new car or new
house on a whim. Consult God. Don't you (or your kids) get involved in
ministries that are not doctrinally and ethically solid. Because a friend
invites him or her to camp doesn't mean you should let your child go. Whether
the issue is how big a house you can afford, how much to give to missions,
whether to join another club, which study Bible to purchase, school choice, or
who to vote for, take these things to God. If he doesn't lead you clearly, if no
Bible verses bear on the situation directly, if the godly are undecided
themselves, then you may have to use wisdom and ask God to stop you if you are
erring. You should not feel pressure to label everything you do &quot;God's
will&quot; or &quot;Spirit-led.&quot; Like Paul, you can say, &quot;...we
thought it best...&quot; (<b>I Thessalonians 3:1</b>). But you should always be able to at
least say, &quot;We consulted God first. He did not lead us clearly, but we
asked him.&quot; If God chooses not to speak, that is his choice. But you must
wait on him and at least give him that opportunity.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, if you learn to consult God habitually, you might be surprised how
many times he does make his direction clear. It would be great if we got to the
point where we were so used to consulting God that we did it automatically.&nbsp;
That's being part of the Lord's army, being a disciple of Christ. As the Jews in
the wilderness following the shekinah cloud of God's presence to the place God
wanted them to camp, so we too need to forsake choosing our own direction.&nbsp;
God
knows best, so let's ask him.</p>
