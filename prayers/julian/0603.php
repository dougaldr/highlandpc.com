<p>My Lord,</p>
<p>You are the one Who &quot;takes out.&quot; You chose the nation of 
Israel for a separate purpose, to be a holy people, not because they earned or 
deserved it in some way 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/deut768.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>). 
You have &quot;visited the Gentiles to 
take out of them a people for [Your] name&quot; (<b>Acts 15:14</b>). Indeed, the word 
&quot;church&quot; means the &quot;called out ones.&quot; And You are the One Who called forth our 
Savior from the dead. Your call for me right now, Lord, is to be holy 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/1pete11516.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). 
Although I am legally holy in Your eyes, my walk does not match my 
talk. Help me to aspire to &quot;walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you 
into His own kingdom and glory&quot; (<b>1 Thessalonians 2:12</b>).</p>
<p>Lord, help me be kind to others. Keep me from mocking them 
when they are clumsy or make sarcastic remarks or use put-down humor. Help me 
to correct but not to scold, to assert myself so I do not store up rage, but to 
assert myself kindly. Keep me from the crude behavior modeled on television and 
contemporary movies. Alert me to where I need to improve my manners and guide 
me to books, resources, or people that will help teach me about kindness and 
courtesy.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You 
today. They are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, marriage is hard work, but it is better to work smarter 
not harder. Help my marriage—and the marriages of those close to me—to be 
successful. Help marriage partners to focus upon their own failings rather than 
those of their spouses. Remind each one that the &quot;heart is deceitful and 
desperately wicked&quot; 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/jer179.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Jeremiah 17:9</a>) 
and therefore it seems to everyone that 
they got the short end of the stick, that they are not so bad in light of how 
they have been treated. </p>
<p>Today, I pray for my community. People who need to know 
Jesus Christ surround me. Many are lonely, depressed—and perhaps even 
dangerous to themselves or others. Lord, I can't help everyone, but help me to 
help someone. Give me the wisdom to know whom I should not try to help; a need 
does not constitute a call. I can't be involved in everything, but help me be 
involved in something. Keep me from cocooning in my own little world, or using 
the church to meet my needs while not meeting the needs of others. Even if I am 
mixing with my community for fun events, I can still be salt and light. Keep me 
from hiding my light under a bushel and may Your Spirit move mightily in my 
area.</p>
<p>Thank You, my Father, for Biblical Ministries Worldwide, &quot;a 
mission agency whose passion is to help churches plant reproducing churches 
through evangelism, discipleship and leadership development.&quot; Thank You for the 
churches they are planting in North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, 
Asia, and the Pacific. We pray that You would grant them harmony among 
themselves, Your Spirit's power to make their ministry effective and pleasing to 
You, safety, wisdom, bountiful fruit for their labors and provision for their 
needs. </p>
<p>Now, Lord, provide for my needs today, I ask in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
