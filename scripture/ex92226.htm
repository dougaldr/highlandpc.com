<p><sup>22</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, 
&quot;Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt--on 
men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.&quot;
<sup>23</sup> When Moses stretched out his staff 
toward the sky, the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to 
the ground. So the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> rained hail on the land of Egypt;
<sup>24</sup> hail fell and lightning flashed 
back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had 
become a nation. <sup>25</sup> Throughout Egypt 
hail struck everything in the fields--both men and animals; it beat down 
everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
<sup>26</sup> The only place it did not hail was 
the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. </p>
