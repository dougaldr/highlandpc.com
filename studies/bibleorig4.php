<br>The Origin of the Bible, Part IV: The New Testament Canon
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>In previous articles, I wrote that the Bible is an 
interlocking book. If you believe in the New Testament, you logically must 
accept the Old Testament because Jesus and the Apostles did so. On the other 
hand, if you embrace the Old Testament, the OT prophecies lead you to Jesus 
Christ. According to 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/dan926.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Daniel 9:26</a>, 
for example, the Messiah would be &quot;cut off,&quot; 
and then later Jerusalem would be destroyed. The destruction of Jerusalem took 
place in 70 A.D., so the Messiah had to be cut off before then. The Old 
Testament describes where the Messiah would be born, His genealogy, deity, 
atoning death on the cross, burial, and resurrection. If you believe in Jesus, 
you must therefore trust the writings of those He personally trained and 
authorized to initiate the church.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that the four Gospels, Paul's 
epistles, Hebrews, 1 Peter, 1 John, and Revelation were completed by 95 A.D. 
They were written in the common (<i>koine</i>) Greek, the common language of the 
Roman Empire at that time. (Remember, the Romans had conquered the Greek 
Empire, and Greek remained the trade language for at least two centuries before 
Latin prevailed). We have all sorts of evidence, including &quot;hard copy&quot; 
manuscripts, although no originals have survived. We have fragments from a copy 
of John's Gospel (the John Rylands papyrus) that dates to somewhere between 100 
and 125 A.D., just a few years after the original was written (about 90 A.D.). 
The Apostle John was only a teen when Jesus appointed him as one of the twelve 
Apostles, and he wrote his Gospel, epistles, and Revelation as an elderly man, 
so they represent the final books of the New Testament. We may have papyrus 
fragments of Matthew from perhaps 70 A.D. (the Magdalen Papyrus), although most 
scholars date this later. We have complete copies of the entire New Testament 
from the fourth century.</p>
<p>Despite the attempts by the Roman government to burn copies 
of New Testament Scriptures, and despite persecution, the New Testament was 
copied and translated so aggressively that we have literally thousands of 
ancient manuscripts from which to evaluate the original text of the New 
Testament. There is no book in ancient times more documented than the New 
Testament, nor are there any ancient books with surviving copies so near to the 
time of writing.</p>
<p>We have so many quotations from the New Testament in the 
writings of the &quot;church fathers&quot; that we could reconstruct the entire New 
Testament (except for 11 verses) from their writings alone! In the latter 
second century, Christians began translating the New Testament into the Latin 
(&quot;old Italian&quot;) and Syrian languages. We have ancient copies in those languages 
as well. All in all, we have 10,000 ancient copies of parts or all of the New 
Testament. The New Testament is the best-documented book of antiquity.</p>
<p>The preservation of the New Testament books is one thing, 
but we need to ask several questions: 1) How did church leaders recognize which 
books were inspired Scripture? 2) Were there any books that were questioned or 
rejected in this process? and 3) How serious are the differences between the 
ancient manuscripts?</p>
<p>How did church leaders recognize which books were inspired 
Scripture? For most of the New Testament, this was a no-brainer. Unlike most 
ancient literature, which first circulated as oral tradition (sometimes for 
centuries) and then was finally written down, the New Testament was written by 
believers who were contemporaries with Jesus Christ. So by the middle of the 
second century, most of the New Testament Scriptures were firmly established 
because Christians were convinced that those who founded the church authored 
them in the first century. This was the key criterion: were the books authored 
while at least some apostles were still alive, and were the authors themselves 
either apostles or close associates of the apostles? If so, then their 
teachings and writings were authoritative. And that &quot;authoritative&quot; issue is 
the heart of canonicity, the measuring stick of truth.</p>
<p>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and all of Paul's epistles 
were immediately received. Their authorship, integrity, and &quot;apostolic era&quot; 
antiquity were well established. So were 1 Peter, 1 John, and Revelation. 
Later on some church leaders doubted Revelation because it is so unusual, but 
the fact it was received early implies no original question of its authorship.</p>

  <table class="sidebar" align="right">
    <tr>
      <th>
        <p>Jude and Enoch</p>
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Because of Jude's 
quotation of a rejected book, many ancient church leaders were uneasy about 
including Jude in the canon. Neither Protestants nor Catholics accept the Book 
of Enoch as authoritative and trustworthy. It was a third century B.C. Jewish 
fabrication (though quite an interesting read in places). </p>
<p>When Jude quotes from Enoch, he does not use the formula 
typically associated with the New Testament standard for quoting Scripture (&quot;it 
is written&quot;), but proceeds right into the quotation (Jude 14). Scholars have 
offered a number of suggestions to account for Jude referring to this book. Here 
is my view.</p>
<p>Jude was writing out against early Gnostic heretics, and he 
is above board about it. He is out to defend the faith handed down by Jesus and 
the Apostles (Jude 1:3). These Gnostics accepted the <i>Book of Enoch</i> as 
part of their canon. Surprisingly, the <i>Book of Enoch</i> is very much in line 
with mainstream Judaism and Christianity. <b>So Jude quotes one of his 
adversaries' books to use against his adversary.</b> He is basically saying, 
&quot;you heretics do not even believe the books you say are inspired. Look at what 
Enoch says…&quot;</p></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>You need to understand that the early church was made up of 
many individual congregations with strong local leaders. As a result, there 
were a number of &quot;local canons.&quot; Some New Testament books were accepted by some 
leaders but not by others; we call these &quot;The Disputed Books.&quot; These include: 
Hebrews (because we are uncertain who the author is, though no one questioned it 
as have originated among the first generation of believers), James (because it 
apparently contradicted Paul), 2 Peter (some doubted whether Peter really wrote 
this and whether it was a first or second century work), 2 and 3 John (perhaps 
debating how useful they were), and Jude (because of its quotation from the Book 
of Enoch). Later, some doubted Revelation because of its unique content and 
style.</p>
<p>There also were a couple of books that some argued should 
be included in the New Testament: The Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistle of 
Clement. These were finally rejected, not because there was a question of 
authorship but because they were written after the apostles had died. The 
Muratorian fragment (ca. 170 A.D.) lists most of our books of the Bible, 
including Jude, Revelation and 1 and 2 John, rejects the Shepherd of Hermas, but 
is silent about Hebrews, James, and 2 Peter. Origen (225 A.D.) accepts Hebrews, 
rejects James, 1 and 2 John, 2 Peter, Jude, but accepts Revelation. Eusebius 
(324 A.D.) only accepts Hebrews (of the disputed books), even rejecting 
Revelation. Cyril (348) accepts all the disputed books that found their way 
into our New Testament except for Revelation. In Syria, the Apostolic Canons 
(380) accept all the New Testament books except for Revelation, but includes the 
Epistle of Clement.</p>
<p>The Gnostic Gospels, mentioned in <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, 
were all written after the apostolic era by groups of religious cults with their 
special agendas that mixed eastern religion with smatterings of Christianity. 
The oldest of these is really not a gospel, but a collection of supposed sayings 
of Jesus, titled &quot;The Gospel of Thomas&quot; and is early second century. Most of 
the Gnostic Gospels are 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> century fabrications.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that during the Reformation, 
Luther and Calvin reexamined the issue. They both eventually concluded that 
the early church leaders had done well, although, for a while Luther rejected 
James. He finally accepted it, though he never liked it, and labeled it &quot;an 
epistle of straw.&quot;</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, here is an honest assessment of the 
canon of the New Testament. These books were accepted as authoritative very 
early on, either immediately or by the mid-second century (as soon as they 
circulated): Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, 1 and 2 
Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 
Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, 1 Peter, 1 John, and 
Revelation.</p>
<p>So when people claim that the New Testament canon was not 
firmly established until the fourth century, there is some truth in that claim. 
But the heart of the New Testament – the books mentioned above, were no-brainers 
and were accepted. The heart of the canon was established almost immediately.</p>
<p>So do the rest of the books belong in the New Testament? I 
believe so. Hebrews and James, for example, clearly date from the apostolic era, 
and the authors were close associates of the apostles. The case for 2 Peter is 
not quite as clear, though obviously strong enough to satisfy evangelical (and 
other forms of Christianity) scholars worldwide. Readers can find information 
about why these books are authentic and belong in our Bibles by reading the 
introductory section of solid Bible commentaries by publishers like Moody, 
Zondervan, Baker, Eerdmans, IVP, etc. We will address manuscript differences 
and a few other odds and ends in our next installment.</p>
