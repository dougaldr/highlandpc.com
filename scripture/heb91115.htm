<p><sup>11</sup> When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are 
already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is 
not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation.
<sup>12</sup> He did not enter by means of the 
blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by 
his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
<sup>13</sup> The blood of goats and bulls and 
the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify 
them so that they are outwardly clean. <sup>14</sup> How 
much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit 
offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead 
to death, so that we may serve the living God! 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> For this reason Christ is the 
mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised 
eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the 
sins committed under the first covenant.</p>
