<p><sup>15</sup> &quot;And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring 
and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&quot; <sup>16</sup> To the woman he said, &quot;I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; 
with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, 
and he will rule over you.&quot;</p>
