<p>O God,</p>
<p>Thank You that You are not interested in religion. True 
Christianity comes about when You indwell us. Your Holy Spirit 
regenerates us—gives us new birth. He then works within us so that we do that which is 
pleasing to You. You do not have to regenerate and renew us, but You do so 
because You are a gracious God. And so You want a people with hearts for You, 
not a people trying to keep You at bay with countless rituals or manmade 
religion.</p>
<p>O Lord, thank You that You want me. You don't want my 
money, my energy, my time, or to remove joy from my life. You want my heart to 
be aflame for You. You want me to enjoy You and take pleasure in Who You are. 
How different this is from the attempts to control You espoused within many 
religions. You are not a God Who will be controlled or manipulated. You are 
good to us out of Your grace.</p>
<p>Lord, Your Word tells me to be still and remember that You 
are God (<b>Psalm 46:10</b>). Sometimes I scurry about in a frenzy and forget that You 
are God. I make decisions as though I were my own boss, forgetting that You are 
God and want to be consulted. Let me be still and remember that You are God!</p>
<p>O, Lord, please bring help to the hurting, the emotionally 
wounded and the devastated. Strengthen those stung by disappointment, 
encourage the demoralized and bind up the emotionally wounded. Especially help: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, today I remember the nations in which believers are 
persecuted. O Father, may these and others among the 86 persecuting countries 
become enlightened in the realm of human dignity and God-given rights including 
the right we have to choose and practice our religious convictions. May the 
persecutors themselves be won to faith in Christ, may the governments mandate 
and enforce the recognition of true religious freedom and help believers by 
granting them an extra portion of wisdom. Help them to evade persecution when 
possible and help them to find their strength in You when they cannot. Bless 
those ministries (Open Doors, Voice of the Martyrs and others) that seek to 
minister to these victims. Remind and impress believers everywhere to remember 
the persecuted church in prayer.</p>
<p>Lord I pray for the U.S. Virgin Islands. Father, the 
tourism and immigration have created a crime industry. The moral values of the 
people have been weakened. Thank You that nearly 26% of the population claims 
to be born-again Christians, but the church is in dire need of revival. O Lord, 
do a work of Your Spirit in this territory of 92,000 people.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, for Shalom International. &quot;The Shalom 
outreach takes in the world—as near as Mexico and as far as India—'to the Jew 
first and also to the Gentile.' That is the message of Shalom in living and 
giving the good news of Jesus Christ to the Jews, Israel and the world.&quot; This 
ministry defends Israel's right to exist and reminds Christians of our Jewish 
roots. O Lord, provide for, protect and empower this ministry. Grant the 
workers harmony among themselves, I pray.</p>
<p>Now empower me to serve You today, I ask in Jesus' Name, 
Amen.</p>
