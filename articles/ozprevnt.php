<br>An Ounce of Prevention...

<p>Which man do you believe served the Kingdom of God better: a
man who reared
his two children well (and they are both walking with the Lord) and reached
one other person for Christ in his lifetime (and he is walking with the
Lord), or the man whose children have little use for God but who has seen
ten professions of faith with two converts walking closely with God? Suppose 
we up the ante to three or even five converts who are walking with God?

Although we do not realize it, the way we answer that question can determine
the focus of a church. You see, every church has its own character and
value system. True, not every church member necessarily agrees with that
set of values, but it still dominates the congregation. It seems a
no-brainer to me that most of our church folks would prefer the first
scenario. I certainly do. This is not to say that we can ever guarantee
that scenario.

<p align="justify">
True, we are not always forced to choose between the options above. There
are many godly men and women who have won scores of folks to Christ and
still have done a great job rearing their children. And, sadly, it is
possible to rear your children well and still see them not walk with Jesus.&nbsp;
Each of us has a will, and we cannot and should not attempt to rob our
children of the choice to either accept or reject the Lordship of Jesus
Christ. While they are minors, we can demand they obey certain
restrictions, but conviction must come from the heart. With the freedom to
surrender to Christ comes the freedom not to surrender to Him.

Here at HPC, I believe we should do a better job of reaching the lost,
particularly as individuals. I believe we should become more alert and
actively seek opportunities to share the good news. Pray for God to open
doors, believe He will, and then look for those doors! Despite our need to
grow in this area, we do have something unique here: a perspective, an
approach to the Christian life that is worth reproducing. And part of that
perspective is the value of preventing problems, both in the spiritual and
relational realm.

Which is better: a church that specializes in reaching homosexuals, or a
church that successfully encourages dads to be involved (but not harsh or
overbearing) with their children, thus preventing the likelihood of
developing homosexual boys? Which is better, a fantastic Christ-centered
drug program or encouraging and helping parents to develop a close, alert,
and proactive relationship with their children, thus preventing drug use in
the first place?

<p align="justify">
Don't get me wrong. I am for reaching out to the gay community. I am
for
programs that help people get off of drugs and into God. I am for rescue,
repair, redemption, and advancing the Gospel. I don't know how someone
could be saved and not be for those things. But the point of my article is
this: ministries of rescue receive a lot of attention and glory, and they
should. But no one seems to laud ministries of nurture and prevention.&nbsp;
No
one writes books about that church with the highly successful marriage rate,
or the church where people stay out of debt and where workaholism is rare.&nbsp;
Sadly, it probably takes a hundred times the funds and a hundred times the
amount of energy to successfully rescue people from these horribly messed-up
lifestyles than it would to prevent them. Even in good programs, the
success rate is limited. On the other hand, if Christian people
prioritized
their families as second only to God, there might be that much less of a
need for rescue. By the way, I said &quot;God&quot; was first. By
&quot;God&quot; I mean a
sincere and consistent walk with God, not just doing church or even good
works.

One of my favorite kind of testimonies goes something like this: &quot;I was
raised in a Christian home. As a child, I accepted the Lord Jesus as my
personal Savior. I never got into drugs, alcohol, or premarital sex.&nbsp;
As I
grew in the Lord, I came to a point where I surrendered my will to Him. I
began having daily devotions and a joyful walk with the Lord. The Holy
Spirit led me to serve the Lord in the church. I prayerfully sought the
mate of God's choosing. We were married, had children who now know and
love
the Lord. We've had a faithful prayer life, and we are always eager to
house and help missionaries. We are connected to our community and have a
lot of good clean fun. It hasn't always been easy, but it has been rich,
deep, and fulfilling. As my spouse and I look back over our 50 years of
marriage, we are grateful for the people we have gotten close to, reached,
and the joys of serving Him.&quot;

<p align="justify">
Of course they don't print testimonies like that on a tract. But they are
the best of all.

Another important point to ponder is this: there are many lost people out
there who do not live destructive lives. Decent, family-oriented people of
depth who do not know Christ are just as lost as substance abusers or
compulsive gamblers. These folks respect solid families and stability of
character, but they often go unreached because many ministries target only
those whose lives are not working. These folks conclude that church is a
haven for people with tons of baggage. Who will reach these &quot;low
baggage&quot;
people? The answer is simple: we are best at reaching people like
us. People who have it together (Relatively speaking, we are all messed up in
some ways.) are best at attracting others like them to the Gospel. Decent
lost people need to be delivered from the wrath of God through the shed
blood of Jesus Christ. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&nbsp;
Let's not forget that.

<p align="justify">
The possibilities for outreach are limitless. As we reach folks with
troubled pasts&#8212;or those who live lives better than we ourselves do&#8212;we
need to remember that an ounce of prevention really is worth a pound of
cure. Let's reach out, but let's also appreciate the wisdom of personal
preemptive strikes! Turn your heart towards God, then turn it toward home.
