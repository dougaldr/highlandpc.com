<p><sup>3</sup> Some Pharisees came to him to test him.&nbsp; They asked, &quot;Is it
lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?&quot;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> &quot;Haven't you read,&quot; he replied, &quot;that at the
beginning the Creator made them male and female, <sup>5</sup> and said, 'For
this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
and the two will become one flesh'?&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> So they are no longer two, but
one.&nbsp; Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> &quot;Why then,&quot; they asked, &quot;did Moses command that a
man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?&quot;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Jesus&nbsp; replied, &quot;Moses permitted you to divorce your
wives because your hearts were hard.&nbsp; But it was not this way from the beginning.&nbsp;
<sup>9</sup> I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital
unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.&quot;</p>
