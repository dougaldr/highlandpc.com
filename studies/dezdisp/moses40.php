<p>Sometimes people try to explain the miracles in the Bible as mere natural 
	occurrences: </p>
	<p>&quot;It may never rain cats and dogs, but fish, shells, and frogs have indeed 
	fallen from the sky on rare occasions. </p>
	<p>In 1984, live six-inch [15 centimeters] flounders (fish) fell on a London 
	neighborhood. It is thought that a waterspout had lifted them to cloud level 
	from the Thames River, then later dropped them several miles away. The fish 
	were probably as surprised as the people who saw them fall. </p>
	<p>More recently, the fishing port of Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, England 
	experienced a shower of fish on August 6th, 2000. </p>
	<p>Similar stories are told of remarkable &quot;showers&quot; from other locations 
	near open water. In one memorable storm in England in 1844, people held out 
	hats to catch dozens of falling frogs. Such small creatures, once airborne, 
	might be carried aloft for an hour or more within the strong updrafts of a 
	thunderstorm. </p>
	<p>These stories remind us of the plague of frogs that occurred long ago in 
	Egypt (Exodus 8). At that time, however, the frogs came onto the land from 
	the rivers and ponds. This plague was much more extensive than a rare fall 
	of frogs during a local storm.&quot; <br>

<p>What we are trying to do in this part of our series is to start with 
	the Bible and see how history fits in with what God's Word says. </p>
<p>And sometimes it gets amazing. </p>
<p>We are going to see how God prepares Moses for his unique ministry 
	based upon the sure Word of God while also looking at possibilities from 
	historical sources. </p>
	<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>God prepares men and women to serve Him in ways we cannot 
	comprehend – at the time.</u> </p>
<ol type=I><li><p><b>What Exodus Teaches 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex21115.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 2:11-15</a>).</b></p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Moses knew he was a Hebrew (<b>11-12</b>).</p>
	<p>Moses did learn something about God from his father, for in <b>Exodus 
	18:3-4</b>, while he was dwelling in Midian with Jethro his father-in-law, he 
	had two sons. We read, &quot;One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, 'I have 
	become an alien in a foreign land'; and the other was named Eliezer, for he 
	said, 'My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of 
	Pharaoh.'&quot; </p>
<li><p>Moses was not afraid to kill (<b>12</b>).</p>
		<img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/moseskill.jpg" width="216" height="133">
<li><p>Moses was vulnerable to a charge of treason (<b>13-15</b>).</p>
	<p>Since Pharaohs had so much power, the killing of an Egyptian was 
	especially meaningful only because Moses was a Hebrew who was defending a 
	Hebrew.... </p>
<li><p>Moses knew how to escape (<b>15</b>).</p>
</ol>
	<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>God prepares men and women to serve Him in ways we cannot 
	comprehend – at the time.</u> </p>
<li><p><b>What the New Testament Adds 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/acts72029.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 7:20-29</a>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/heb112426.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Hebrews 11:24-26</a>)</b>.<ol type=A><li><p>In <b>Acts:</b><ol type=1>
	<li>
	<p>Raised as the son of Pharaoh's daughter (<b>21</b>), completely adopted with all royal privileges; could be an heir to the 
	throne....<li><p>Fully educated (<b>22a</b>).<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/mosesedu.jpg" width="210" height="280">
<li><p>Powerful in speech (<b>22b</b>).<li><p>Powerful in action (<b>22c</b>).<li><p>Decided to visit fellow Israelites (<b>23</b>).<li><p>He expected his people to rally round him and break free from Egypt (<b>25</b>).</ol> 
<li><p>In <b>Hebrews&nbsp;11:24-26</b> 
	<p>&quot;By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of 
	Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God 
	rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. He regarded 
	disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of 
	Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.&quot; 
<ol type=1><li><p>Made an irreversible choice to identify with the Hebrews.<li><p>Chose to follow God's way over personal comfort.<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>Moses had been trained to become Israel's leader and one of the 
	great men of history. But he was lacking in one quality: humility. The 
	Moses who was powerful in speech and powerful in action was a different man 
	when he first saw the burning bush. So sometimes God prepares us with 
	information and training, and then breaks us so that we are all the more 
	useful.</u><p><u>God prepares men and women to serve Him in ways we cannot comprehend – at 
	the time.</u> </ol></ol>
<li><p><b>What Historical Sources Might Add.</b><ol type=A><li><p>Jewish sources (Josephus, about 90 A.D.).<ol type=1><li><p>Egyptians were in trouble, Nubians/Ethiopian advancing.<li><p>Egyptian prophets had visions to put Moses in charge of army.<li><p>Moses used Ibis birds to eat up snakes so army could advance through the 
	desert and surprise the Nubians – successful. 
<li><p>His successes made the Pharaoh &amp; Egyptian elite afraid of him and looking 
	for an excuse to rid themselves of him… </ol>
<li><p>Possible Egyptian history.<ol type=1><li><p>Princess was Hatshepsut (Nefure).<p>
			<img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/hatshepsut.jpg" width="170" height="200"><li><p>Senmut, possibly Moses.<li><p>Statue of Senmut and Nefure is not Senmut (a man) holding Nefure (baby), 
	but Nefure (a woman) holding Senmut (baby Moses).

<li><p>Complex Egyptian politics explains much (my interpretation).<ol type=1><li><p>Tutmose the first started killing the boys born to the Hebrews.<li>
<p>Nefure/Hatshepsut hates this, rescues Moses; maybe 13 years 
	old. 
<li><p>Her father dies when she is about 15. She marries her half-brother, Tutmose II, who is now a coregent and stops the slaughter; the Egyptians 
	hate her because she loves foreigners and she controls her husband and when 
	her dad dies, the government.
<li><p>Tutmose II dies after only 13 years reigning; Hatshepsut seizes 
	the throne while Tutmoses III, an illegitimate hated step-son (still a 
	child), becomes a coregent without much power; Hatshepsut spoils 
	Moses, and makes him Grand Vizier. She claims she has had visions that the gods 
	want her to be Pharaoh and that her father, Tutmose I, had wanted her to be 
	Pharaoh.
<li><p>In summary, Hatshepsut is in power and wants Moses (Senmut) to 
	be her heir. Her stepson ages, and begins demanding his rightful place as 
	Pharaoh, but is frustrated because Hatshepsut and Senmut have more 
	power.
<li><p>Moses becomes moved to deliver his people, the Hebrews; he begins 
	visiting them more often and trying to rally them. Then Senmut (Moses) 
	mysteriously disappears. A year later, something happens to Hatshepsut -possibly assassinated - and Tutmose III takes the reigns.
<li><p>I would suggest to you that this mysterious disappearance of Senumt was 
	caused when Moses killed the Egyptian. He took off, because now Tutmose III 
	would have a pretext to declare him a traitor and seize real control of 
	Egypt. Without Senmut's leadership, Hatshepsut can no longer 
	resist her stepson.
<li><p>After Hatshepsut dies, Tutmose writes graffiti on her tomb and accuses 
	her and Senmut of all sorts of sexual obscentities. which is why some 
	Egyptologists think that Hatshepsut and Senmut were lovers. If my 
	theory is correct, they were simply a stepmom and son very devoted to one 
	another. Tutmose III tries to destroy all records of Hatshepsut 
	and Senmut.

	<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>God prepares men and women to serve Him in ways we cannot

<li><p><b>Applications.</b><ol type=A><li><p>Many never do what God has prepared them to do.<li><p>Politics is a dirty business.<li><p>Don't forget to think &quot;Lord willing&quot;.<li><p>Failure can be the back door to success.<li>
<p>God's way and God's 
	timing.<li><p>Patience!</ol></ol>
