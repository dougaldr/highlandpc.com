<p><sup>1 </sup>&quot;Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before
men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in
heaven.</p>

<p><sup>2 </sup>&quot;So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with
trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be
honored by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. <sup>3
</sup>But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your
right hand is doing, <sup>4 </sup>so that your giving may be in secret. Then
your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</p>
