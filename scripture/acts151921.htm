<p><sup>19</sup> It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it
difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. <sup>20</sup> Instead we
should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from
sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. <sup>21</sup> For
Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the
synagogues on every Sabbath.</p>
