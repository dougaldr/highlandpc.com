<br>Has Warren Whet Your Appetite to Read?
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>During our first week of &quot;Life With A Purpose&quot; discussions, 
one of the men in our group mentioned that Rick Warren affirmed a well-known HPC 
teaching: God does not need us.</p>
<p>Rick Warren and I came to those conclusions separately; the 
point is pretty obvious in Scripture 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/acts172425.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 17:24-25</a>).
Yet an occasional Ed Vasicek viewpoint does find its origin with Rick Warren. I tapped into Warren’s 
resources around 1990 (via cassette tapes), and I attended Warren’s Indianapolis 
seminar somewhere around 1992.</p>
<p>I have never been one to follow any particular individual; 
I make the Bible my primary source, but I must admit that many have influenced 
my philosophy of ministry over the years. Some such influencers include: John 
Piper, Gene Getz, Warren Wiersbe, David Stern, Howard Hendricks, and, yes, Rick 
Warren. Secular authors David Putnam and Peter Drucker have also contributed 
toward my eclectic perspective.</p>
<p>Over the years I have learned and implemented a lot of 
ideas and changes, some based upon Rick Warren’s suggestions. Although I reject 
his &quot;seeker sensitive&quot; model as God’s direction for our church (and disagree 
with Warren on a number of points), I have selectively incorporated ideas 
congruent with the nature of our congregation while dismissing others.</p>
<p>On a personal note, Warren was the first respected preacher 
with the audacity to say that a good preaching style would be a laid-back 
Christian &quot;Johnny Carson&quot; style. Although we don’t begin my sermons with &quot;And 
now, here’s Eddie,&quot; his suggestion freed me to relax and level with people who I 
view and treat as my equals rather than congregants who need a scolding.</p>
<p>Rick advocated using humor while eliminating stuffy 
Christian &quot;code&quot; words (like the dreaded &quot;we trust that,&quot; &quot;colportage,&quot; and 
&quot;family altar&quot;) and avoiding illustrations &quot;about dead people from England.&quot; He 
encouraged pastors to trash the whole &quot;pretend&quot; thing that still infects much of 
the evangelical world. We can say &quot;I’m worried&quot; without getting lectured as to 
how Christians must not worry but are merely to be &quot;concerned.&quot;</p>
<p>More than any other Christian leader, Warren gave ministers 
permission to be themselves—and to be authentic. We needed someone else to 
affirm what we ourselves sensed: evangelicalism, like Catholicism before it, 
depended upon an artificial (pretend) church environment. This, in turn, 
communicated a division between the faith of the Bible and the real world. 
Warren had an effective ministry—without playing the pretend &quot;create an aura&quot; 
game or bowing down to what was then the party line. Rick Warren was nothing 
short of a laid-back reformer.</p>
<p>Have you heard me say, &quot;At the judgment seat of Christ, 
Christ is going to ask you 'Why weren’t you more you? Why didn’t you utilize 
who I made you to be, and, instead, tried to be someone else?'&quot; Got that from 
Warren back before you had ever heard of him.</p>
<p>Warren writes on page 75 of <i>The Purpose Driven Life</i>, 
&quot;You don’t bring glory or pleasure to God by hiding your abilities or by trying 
to be someone else. You only bring him enjoyment by being you. Anytime you 
reject any part of yourself, you are rejecting God’s wisdom and sovereignty in 
creating you.&quot;</p>
<p>Warren’s book is a good &quot;big picture&quot; summary of the 
purpose of the Christian life. It is not meant to be deep, detailed, or 
accurate down to the detail. I would like to call many of Warren’s assertions, 
&quot;rounded-off truths.&quot; Some of his assertions have exceptions or are open to 
challenge. But that is who Warren is: a man of God who presents a concise 
sketch of the big picture. He is not a theologian or a scholar. That is not 
his strong suit.</p>
<p>And folks, here’s my point: the best way to grow and learn 
from Christian authors or teachers is to hone in on their areas of excellence, 
to take the eclectic approach. Webster defined &quot;eclectic&quot; as &quot;selecting what 
appears to be best in various doctrines, methods, or styles.&quot; With the Bible we 
should not be eclectic, but with human authors, we should always be.</p>
<p>My list as to how other authors have impacted me would show 
that Warren has been merely one of several. Others have contributed and are 
contributing as much or more toward my development as a Christian, a human 
being, a man, father, husband and pastor. I suspect you have room to grow as 
well.</p>
<p>So where do you go next? My advice: keep reading your 
Bible and keep reading other good books as well. Keep reading. You might check 
out John Piper’s, <i>The Pleasures of God</i>, or if you want a classic, John 
Bunyan’s <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>. Men might really enjoy <i>The Man in the 
Mirror</i> by Pat Morley while women might pursue <i>Understanding the Men in 
Your Life</i> by Kevin Leman. James Dobson has penned some fine works about the 
Christian family. You can’t go wrong with Swindoll, Wiersbe or Howard 
Hendricks.</p>
<p>But how can I recognize truly good books? That depends 
upon what you mean by &quot;good.&quot; If you mean entertaining or inspiring, well, 
you’ll need to read someone else’s column. I enjoy a good Perry Mason mystery, 
but it does nothing for my walk with God. If, on the other hand, you mean books 
that will nurture your soul, one thing to look for is the publisher.</p>
<p>Here are some solid publishers in order of my preference: 
Moody Press (or Moody Publishers or Northfield), Navpress, Victor, Broadman, 
Holman, IVP (Intervarsity Press), Baker, Hendrickson, Zondervan, Tyndale and 
Bethany House. Others, like Nelson, Word, and Revell have some great books, but 
they have some pretty shallow ones as well. Some small publishers, like Friends 
of Israel, are wonderful, but I do not have space to list them all.</p>
<p>I have noticed that Christians who spend time in the Word 
AND read good Christian books become much deeper than those who do only one of 
the above or those who only read &quot;feel good&quot; stories. So if <i>The Purpose 
Driven Life</i> has touched your soul, let that inspire you to read on.</p>
