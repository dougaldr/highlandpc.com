<p><sup>14</sup> Then the angel who was speaking 
to me said, &quot;Proclaim this word: This is what the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>
 Almighty says: 'I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, <sup>15</sup> 
but I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little 
angry, but they added to the calamity.'</p>
<p><sup>16</sup> &quot;Therefore, this is what the 
L<span class="sm">ORD</span> says: 'I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and 
there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over 
Jerusalem,' declares the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> Almighty. </p>
