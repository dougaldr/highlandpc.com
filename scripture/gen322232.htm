<p><sup>22</sup> That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, 
his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
<sup>23</sup> After he had sent them across the stream, he sent 
over all his possessions. <sup>24</sup> So Jacob was left alone, 
and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. <sup>25</sup> When 
the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's 
hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
<sup>26</sup> Then the man said, &quot;Let me go, for it is 
daybreak.&quot;</p> 
<p>But Jacob replied, &quot;I will not let you go unless you bless me.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>27</sup> The man asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Jacob,&quot; he answered. </p>
<p><sup>28</sup> Then the man said, &quot;Your name will no 
longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men 
and have overcome.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>29</sup> Jacob said, &quot;Please tell me your name.&quot; </p>
<p>But he replied, &quot;Why do you ask my name?&quot; Then he blessed him there. </p>
<p><sup>30</sup> So Jacob called the place Peniel,  
saying, &quot;It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>31</sup> The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,
and he was limping because of his hip. <sup>32</sup> Therefore 
to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the 
hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon. </p>
