<p>

Highland Park Church was incorporated on January 4, 1949, by a group of about
130 folks who split from a mainline church. The church was committed
to conservative Biblical faith from its inception.</p>

<p>
The church was named Highland Park Church because the fellowship's
original intent was to purchase property near Highland Park and construct its building there.
Zoning problems thwarted the original plan, but the members
wanted to retain the name of the church despite its location nearer to Foster Park.
</p>
<p>
That same year, 1949, the church bought the Conradt Mansion, a beautiful 
World War I vintage mansion at 516 West Sycamore Street. They
converted the first floor to a chapel. The basement, originally a wine
cellar, became the fellowship hall. The third floor had been
built originally as a ballroom, but, along with the second floor, was turned into the
pastor's family quarters.</p>

<p>
In 1954, the main auditorium was constructed. It was added onto the mansion 
in such a way that the building appears to be one structure. In 1956, 
the church purchased the house at 502 West Sycamore Street for a parsonage.</p>

<p>
The church reached its high mark numerically in the early 1960s, averaging just
shy of 200 in the morning service. Its emphasis was foreign missions.
A decline began in 1963 and continued for over twenty years. By the
time our current pastor, Ed Vasicek, began his duties in late 1983, attendance was averaging in the
70s. The church was filled with older
folk; only two couples could be labeled young adults.
We now average 100 between the morning services.</p>

<p>
Over the years, our ministries have included: children's
church, Awana, Bible Clubs, children's choir, home flock groups, prayer chain, library,
and the tabernacle replica ministry. We are proud that three
families from our church have been called to the mission field and another
family to the pastorate.</p>

<p>
Our mission&#0151;to reach people with the Gospel, to connect believers to one
another and to God, and to deepen believers&#0151;provides us with a
pinpoint direction. We are attempting to improve on all fronts, utilizing
every attender as he or she is gifted and able. We are excited and positive about our future!</p>
