<p>Kindly King of Kings,</p>
<p>Your Son called Himself “The Bread of God” 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/john633.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 6:33</a>) 
and “The Bread out of Heaven” 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/john632.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 6:32</a>). 
Just as bread feeds the body, so He 
feeds the soul. The bread that fell out of heaven, the manna, was freely given, 
as is the Savior. The manna sustained daily life, but the eaters were soon 
hungry again. But Jesus feeds the soul in such a way that it never need hunger 
again. Bread is used to refer to daily sustenance, food in general. Without 
it, we perish. So without Jesus Christ, our souls are doomed to a Christless 
eternity. He is the Bread that came out of heaven, the Bread of God.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to take seriously the command to “Carry each 
other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ” (<b>Galatians 
6:2</b>). Lord, when I am burdened, I want others to help me, but do I reach out to 
help others? Am I looking to be an encouragement, to pray with another, and to 
show in some clear way that I care? I know Your Word doesn’t have this 
verse just to take up space, but it is a very real responsibility you have given 
to me and all believers.</p>
<p>I pray for my lost friends and family members, including: __________. 
Father, please send Your Spirit to draw them to Yourself and grant 
them the repentance that leads to life.</p>
<p>Lord, like everyone else, I have fears and insecurities 
that haunt me. I give them to You and ask You to help me constantly do so.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to get to know my neighbors where I live and 
at work or school. Teach me the importance of participating in my community as 
an avenue to benefit myself and a way to show love to others.</p>
<p>Father, I am so grateful to hear of how well the Gospel has 
been received among the people of the African nation of Malawi. Thank You that 
over 20% of the population claim to be born-again evangelicals. Thank You that 
You are working in mighty ways. Help leadership training to improve. May the 
seminaries and colleges take a firm stand for the fundamentals of the faith. 
Help the believers there reach the Muslim people groups with the true Gospel of 
Christ. May the evangelical church grow by 50% over the next decade and may 
the believers there exemplify maturity. Help the church address the growing 
AIDS crisis.</p>
<p>Lord, I remember Missionary Gospel Fellowship
<span class="lead">whose purpose </span>is “to reach the unreached in North 
America with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. MGF missionaries have ministered from 
the southern tip of Florida to the hills of South Carolina and Georgia to 
Chicago’s bustling Muslim community...riding the range with the cowboys in 
Montana, counseling Mormons in Idaho, evangelizing in New Mexico and Texas, or 
training nationals in Mexico.” Father, grant the workers harmony among 
themselves, provide for them and their families, empower them by Your Spirit 
and give them great fruit for their labor.</p>
<p>Now help me to have a fruitful day and to stay alert for 
doors You may choose to open, I request in Christ’s Name, Amen.</p>
