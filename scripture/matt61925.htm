<p><sup>19</sup> Do not store up for yourselves treasures on 
earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
<sup>20</sup> But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, 
where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
<sup>21</sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will 
be also.</p>   
<p><sup>22</sup> The eye is the lamp of the body. If your 
eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light. <sup>23</sup> But 
if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the 
light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness! </p>
<p><sup>24</sup> No one can serve two masters. Either he 
will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and 
despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money. </p>
<p><sup>25</sup> Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your 
life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not 
life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?</p>
