<p><sup>5</sup> Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: <sup>6</sup>
Who being in very nature God did not consider equality with God something to be
grasped, <sup>7</sup> but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a
servant being made in human likeness.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> And being found in appearance
as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death&#151;even death on a
cross!&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him
the name that is above every name.</p>
