<br>March 29
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</p>

<p>Dear Lord,</p>
<p>You are the Lawgiver. Our consciences testify that there 
is indeed such a thing as right and wrong. This reminds us that there is a 
standard, and that standard exists because You have written Your law on our 
hearts. You have the right to announce what is right and wrong, for You are 
perfect in all Your ways. Your justice and holiness are reflected in Your Law. 
Our opinions are no competition for Your Word. Your Word reflects Your will and 
is based upon Your Law. You do not merely share opinions.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You that You planned for Jesus Christ to die 
for our sins before the world was founded. Thank You that He took all my sins 
upon the cross as a sin offering. Thank You that He presented His blood to You 
in the heavenly sanctuary, and that His offering was for all people for all 
time. Thank You that our Savior arose from the dead.</p>
<p>Although the Savior is my friend, I also have a fierce 
enemy. Help me to resist temptations and traps of the devil. May I not be 
ignorant of his schemes. Instead, may I cling to You, my God, and may I take up 
Your armor. I put on the helmet of salvation, the breastplate of righteousness, 
the belt of truth, and my feet are ready to go and share Your good news. I take 
up the shield of faith and I boldly wield the sword of the Spirit, Your Word.</p>
<p>Father, help parents throughout our world. Although I pray 
especially for the parents who know You, I pray for all parents. Motivate them 
to do what is in the best long-term interest of their child or children. Keep 
them from abusing their children and from spoiling them. May parents take 
seriously the responsibility to be a good example, to keep their marriages 
together when possible, and to nurture their child’s/children’s moral 
education. Give parents great wisdom to face the challenges of the modern 
world. We pray that more and more parents would surrender their lives to Jesus 
Christ.</p>
<p>Today I pray for the nation of Estonia. Thank You that 
this land is now free from the former Soviet Union and that religious freedom 
is a reality. Thank You for the 5.7% of the population that claim to be 
born-again evangelical believers, and thank You for the missionary efforts from 
nearby Finland. Prosper the new leadership training schools. May the church 
grow numerically and double within the next five years. May Your Spirit sweep 
over this land.</p>
<p>I remember Compassion International in my prayers. “Compassion International 
exists as an advocate for children, releasing them from spiritual, economic, 
social&nbsp;and physical poverty&nbsp;and enabling them to become responsible, fulfilled 
Christian adults.... Today, Compassion helps&nbsp;more than&nbsp;728,800 children in more 
than 20 countries.” So, Father, provide support and safety for the workers, 
sponsors for children, and the blessings of Your Spirit. Help the workers to 
experience harmony with one another and may they have Your wisdom as they 
engage in working for Your Kingdom.</p>
<p>I pray for those who work as lawyers throughout our land. Help them to be 
honest, ethical and conscientious. May those who know You freely share their 
faith with their peers and their clients and may many attorneys come to know 
Jesus Christ in the next few years.</p>
<p>So, Lord, I 
surrender myself afresh to You today in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
