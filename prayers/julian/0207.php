<br>February 7

<p>Great God,</p>
<p>You are Adonai, You are Lord of the Estate known as all 
creation! You are the Master, You have dominion over all things and are worthy 
of our allegiance, respect, and obedience. You own all. Although we possess 
many things for a time as Your stewards, we own nothing. You are the Lord 
Adonai, our true and most worthy King and Master.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for saving me from sin. Sin is not just 
what I do, it is also what I fail to do to please You. Sin is not just my 
action, but it is part of my nature. My heart is deceitful and desperately 
wicked. My attitude is contaminated by sin, so it is out of my heart that 
sinful actions flow. As You help me grow, my new nature becomes more dominant, 
and my heart of flesh begins to overtake my heart of stone. Help me to remember 
that sin is not just what I do, but it is part of who I am, the old me.</p>
<p>So, Lord, I want to see more holiness in my life. I want 
to be set apart for Your use, and I want You to feel completely at home in my 
life. Help me to be special for You.</p>
<p>Today I pray for my marriage (if I am married) and the 
marriages of those around me. Marriage has fallen on rough times, but it is 
near to Your heart, since You instituted it. Help me to encourage growth in my 
own marriage (if I am married), to find the right mate (if that is Your will), 
or to be content with my single estate (if that is Your will). But whatever my 
lot, help me to be social and proactive, because I cannot really love people if 
I evade them.</p>
<p>Help me be alert to Satan's schemes. Help me to take up 
the full armor of God and to draw near to You, O Lord. Help me to resist the 
devil, and he will flee. Place a hedge around me so the evil one cannot hinder 
my service to You, Father.</p>
<p>Thank You for the African country of Botswana. Although 
the Gospel has penetrated this society, the church is often made up of nominal 
Christians. AIDS is a serious problem in this country, and churches that 
promise healing are drawing people away from more Biblically-based 
congregations. Tribal religions are often unyielding to the Gospel, and many Botswanians combine Christian belief with tribal religion and superstition. 
Help the truly saved to become firm and uncompromising in their beliefs. May 
Christians maintain a high moral standard and may they participate in Biblically 
sound congregations. May the number of genuine believers double over the next 
five years, and Lord, please raise up strong leaders from within the church 
there.</p>
<p>Today I pray for Galcom International as they supply 
equipment to help reach people with the Gospel, particularly through short wave 
radio opportunities. They have provided 400,000 fix-tuned radios in 117 
countries, radios that remained tuned to Christian stations only. As a result, 
thousands are being reached and discipled. Provide for this ministry in every 
way: financially, relationally, and spiritually. Use them to impact many for 
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Today I pray for our local district attorneys. These 
individuals perform an important function as they seek to keep criminals behind 
bars. Help them to seek justice and have your priorities. Keep them from 
wrongly condemning the innocent, and give them wisdom in rightfully and 
successfully prosecuting the guilty.</p>
<p>Lord, this world is challenging. Help me never to fear, 
but to remember that You are by my side.</p>
<p>I pray in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
