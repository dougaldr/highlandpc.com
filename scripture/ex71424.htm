<p><sup>14</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, 
&quot;Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.
<sup>15</sup> Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he 
goes out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in 
your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
<sup>16</sup> Then say to him, 'The L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, the God 
of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let my people go, so that they may 
worship me in the desert. But until now you have not listened.
<sup> 17</sup> This is what the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> says: By this 
you will know that I am the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>: With the staff that is in my hand I will 
strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.
<sup>18</sup> The fish in the Nile will die, and 
the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.' &quot; </p>
<p><sup>19</sup> The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Tell 
Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over 
the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs'-and they will 
turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden buckets and 
stone jars.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>20</sup> Moses and Aaron did just as the 
L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his 
officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into 
blood. <sup>21</sup> The fish in the Nile died, 
and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood 
was everywhere in Egypt.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup> But the Egyptian magicians did 
the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would 
not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
<sup>23</sup> Instead, he turned and went into 
his palace, and did not take even this to heart.
<sup>24</sup> And all the Egyptians dug along the 
Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river. </p>
