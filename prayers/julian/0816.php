<p>Great One,</p>
<p>Even though You are Three Persons, You are One God. You 
have one purpose, one plan and one direction. The Holy Spirit will never lead 
us in a way that conflicts with the Father or Son. The written Word of 
Scripture will never contradict the Living Word, the Lord Jesus Christ, or the 
Spirit Who inspired the written Word according to the will of the Father. Lord, 
in this life we deal with organizations or families where we cannot get a 
consistent answer. But You are One God with one plan and one set of values.</p>
<p>Lord, Your 
word says, &quot;A prudent man keeps his knowledge to himself, but the heart of fools 
blurts out folly&quot; (<b>Proverbs 12:23</b>). O Father, help me not to be a bragger or a 
showoff. Instead let time and wisdom help others form a true opinion of me. 
Remind me that &quot;Fear of man will prove to be a snare, but whoever trusts in the 
L<span class="sm">ORD</span> is kept safe&quot; (<b>Proverbs 29:25</b>). Although I 
should care about my deportment and my manners and I should consider other people, 
I have a freedom in Christ. My self-esteem comes from being in Christ, not just from 
impressing people. May humility be my trademark, I ask.</p>
<p>Lord, I am thankful for many things three of which are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may fill me. May I&nbsp;find my 
strength in His power, not my own. May Your Spirit control me today.</p>
<p>Lord, make me 
to hunger for Your Word. Like the Psalmist, may I have this mentality, &quot;Your 
statutes are my delight; they are my counselors&quot; (<b>Psalm 119:24</b>). O Father, You 
went through great effort to get Your Word to us; many have died to preserve it 
and missionaries give their lives to translate it while scholars have worked to 
make it intelligible in our language. But all this is in vain if I do not read 
and study it. Only You can create an appetite for Scripture in my heart 
although I can nurture it or subdue it. I need Your Spirit to open up its 
meaning and to help me apply it.</p>
<p>I praise You 
for the believers who live in the African island nation of St. Helena. Although 
5.2% of the population claims to be born-again evangelicals, the church there is 
on the decline. Churches are elderly the young people are into materialism. O 
Father, spark a revival in the church there and may the church buildings be 
filled with young people who are eager to serve You! You can do this by Your 
Spirit, we have no doubt. We pray that You would.</p>
<p>I remember 
Christ For The Island World, a ministry that has been &quot;planting churches using 
nationals since 1983. [They] are currently assisting in several regions of 
Indonesia among the Hindu, Muslim and Animist people. [They] also have similar 
work in Russia and Ukraine that was started in the 1990s.&quot; O Father, prosper, 
bless, empower, protect, grant harmony and provide much fruit for this 
ministry! May they glorify You as they lead others into Your Kingdom.</p>
<p>Help me to 
glorify You today, I ask in the Savior's Name, Amen.</p>
