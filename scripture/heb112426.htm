<p><sup>24 </sup>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as
the son of Pharaoh's daughter.&nbsp; <sup>25 </sup>He chose to be mistreated along
with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short
time.&nbsp; <sup>26 </sup>He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater
value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.<br>
