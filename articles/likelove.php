<br>Why Liking Is Better Than Loving
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Agatha Christie, is, admittedly, my favorite fiction writer. I enjoy a good
&quot;who done it&quot; once in a while, and few mystery writers can compete
with this great author. But Agatha Christie also understood human nature.&nbsp;
She
herself had suffered a painful divorce when young, but was extremely happily
married to her second husband.</p>

<p>
During a &quot;happy ending&quot; scene in one of her books, the sleuth and his
fiancé (whose heart was won while helping to solve the mystery), Bridget,
makes an interesting observation: &quot;I like you, Luke....Liking is more
important than loving. It lasts. I want what is between us to last, Luke.&nbsp;
I
don't want us just to love each other and marry and get tired of each other, and
then want to marry someone else...&quot; (Christie, Agatha, <u> Easy To Kill</u>,
G.K.
Hall &amp; Co., 1938, renewed 1967).</p>

<p>
Indeed, some Bible scholars are now gravitating toward an emphasis on brotherly
love (the Greek word phileo) because affection and attachment are implied in
it, as well as the concept of liking&#151;verses agape (the common Greek word for
love), which is more the love of duty. You can agape your enemies, but we are
nowhere commanded to phileo them. Phileo is reserved for those with whom we
cultivate a relationship.</p>

<p>
This bit of wisdom applies to marriage (and why marriages often go awry). It is
great to actually LIKE the person you are married to. And part of being a good
spouse is the determination to work at becoming likable.</p>

<p>
The same is true of a church. It is one thing to tolerate a church, another to
love it. Indeed, for some people, the church they settle upon is the &quot;least
worst choice.&quot; They are not really happy there, but it's the best they can
find. Sometimes, in time, they learn to like the church and enjoy its people.&nbsp;
Other times, they just wander around in a cloud of discontent. Then they
frequent another church and repeat the cycle.</p>

<p>
Sometimes they feel a void and expect the church to fill it. Other times the
problem is that they are not particularly &quot;likable&quot; people. They sense
they are not well-liked because they aren't. Not that they are necessarily
disliked, just not liked.</p>

<p>
The Bible has much to say about liking and being likable. Jesus, it is said in <b>
Luke 2:52</b>, grew in &quot;favor with God and men.&quot; Put simply, the Father
and people liked Him. Late in life, as Christ proclaimed truth, truth-haters
became His enemy. But it was truth, not His character, that created the
antagonism. He was a likable man.</p>

<p>
The Bible commands us to love our enemies, but we do not have to like them.&nbsp;
In
that instance, loving them means to treat them in a loving way (do unto others
as you would have them do unto you). But to those we wish to be close to, it is
great to not only love them, but to also like them. This simple dynamic is being
lost in all the &quot;love talk&quot; common in our churches today.</p>

<p>
Indeed, friendship, especially close friendship, best occurs when individuals
like one another. You can love an acquaintance and have a ministry with that
person, but being a friend requires liking. In addition, the most satisfying
friendships are between people roughly equal in intelligence, ability, etc.,
though gifted perhaps in differing ways. But they must like one another.&nbsp;
We are
commanded to love others, but we are not commanded to like others. Liking cannot
be willed, loving can.</p>

<p>
David and Jonathan liked one another. Their special brotherly love was
intensified by their enjoyment, their liking of one another. Jesus and John the
Apostle had a special friendship as well because there was a certain chemistry
present. Ruth and Naomi had a special love for one another, but one senses they
also liked each other.</p>

<p>
If &quot;liking and being likable&quot; is key to satisfying marriage, close
friendship, and church life, how can we develop this &quot;like-ability?&quot;&nbsp;
The answer to this question can be involved if we answer it with specifics.&nbsp;
But
there is a general answer to keep in mind, found for us in <b> Proverbs 3:3-4</b>,
namely, &quot;Do not let kindness and truth leave you. Bind them around your
neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good
name with God and men.&quot;</p>

<p>
There are basically two element to becoming likable, or &quot;finding favor in
the sight of God and men.&quot; These elements are: kindness (love,
consideration, gentleness) and truth (honesty, faithfulness, dependability).&nbsp;
If
we are only kind but not truthful, we are nothing more than people pleasers.&nbsp;
If
we are truthful but not kind, we are harsh moralists or perfectionist snobs.</p>

<p>
People pleasers end up with many acquaintances and are well-liked superficially,
but have few deep friendships. They make great politicians but are often taken
with a grain of salt. Honest people without kindness may be respected, but few
wish to be close to such individuals. It takes a mixture of both qualities, or,
as Paul puts it in <b>Ephesians</b>, &quot;...speaking the truth in love.&quot;</p>

<p>
When mixing kindness and truth, a person may choose to say nothing. Because
something is true does not mean she must state it. And how it is said, how it is
perceived will be taken into account.</p>

<p>
Are you known for being considerate? Do you stretch and manipulate the truth, or
are you merely tactful in kindness? Are you concerned about how you are
perceived? You ought to be. Kindness demands it. Out of love and concern, we may
need to force ourselves to be initiators. If you want to have friends, you must
yourself be friendly.</p>

<p>
Love is important. But so is likability. Do you like your spouse?&nbsp;
Does your
spouse like you? Do you like your children? Do they like you? What about your
church family? Your neighbor? If you care, you'll be considerate.&nbsp;
It's not
enough just to do your duty. You must be concerned about how you come across.&nbsp;
Find that balance of kindness and truth!</p>

<p>
Here's the challenge. Think about what it must be like to be married to you.&nbsp;
Or
what it is like to work alongside you. Or how you are perceived by others.&nbsp;
What
behaviors and attitudes do you have that make you unattractive to those who are
close to you? Are they matters of truth, or self-centeredness? Are you kind?&nbsp;
Are
you sincere and honest, even when uncomfortable. Then seek to correct those
faults. Bring them into conformity with the dual concepts of kindness and truth.&nbsp;
Begin at home.</p>
