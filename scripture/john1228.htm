<p><sup>2</sup> Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha 
served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
<sup>3</sup> Then Mary took about a pint 
of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his 
feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 
<p><sup>4</sup> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, 
who was later to betray him, objected, <sup>5</sup> “Why wasn't 
this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages.” 
<sup>6</sup> He did not say this because he cared about the 
poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help 
himself to what was put into it. </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> “Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was 
intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
<sup>8</sup> You will always have the poor among you, but you 
will not always have me.” </p>
