<p><sup>13</sup> Now that same day two of them were going to a 
village called Emmaus, about seven miles 
from Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup> They were talking with each other 
about everything that had happened. <sup>15</sup> As they 
talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and 
walked along with them; <sup>16</sup> but they were kept from 
recognizing him.</p>   
<p><sup>17</sup> He asked them, “What are you discussing 
together as you walk along?” </p>
<p>They stood still, their faces downcast. <sup>18</sup> One 
of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do 
not know the things that have happened there in these days?” </p>
<p><sup>19</sup> “What things?” he asked. </p>
<p>“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in 
word and deed before God and all the people. <sup>20</sup> The 
chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they 
crucified him; <sup>21</sup> but we had hoped that he was the 
one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since 
all this took place. <sup>22</sup> In addition, some of our 
women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning.</p>
