<p>Lord,</p>
<p>When Mary was expecting Jesus and went to visit her 
elderly relative, Elizabeth, who was also with child, John the Baptist leaped 
for joy in Elizabeth's womb. Mary then broke forth in praise.</p>
<p>She said, &quot;My soul glorifies the Lord, and rejoices in God 
my Savior&quot; (<b>Luke 1:46</b>). Father, as we enter into this Christmas season, help us 
not forget the simplicity of it all. We glorify You: You are the driving force 
of our lives.</p>
<p>We rejoice in You as God; we put away the &quot;gods&quot; that 
compete with You, for You allow us no other gods. You alone are to be our 
Master.</p>
<p>You are our Savior. Mary needed a Savior because she was a 
sinner like the rest of us. Only Jesus Christ lived a sinless life. Only Jesus 
Christ was born of a virgin so that he would not be tainted by the sin of Adam. 
But the rest of us are sinful when we compare ourselves to Your holiness. 
That's why we need a Savior: we have nothing to offer You to atone for our sin. 
We owe you 100% obedience to begin with. If we err even once, how could we give 
you more than 100% of what is left to make up for what is lacking? We cannot. 
That is why we must be passively saved, merely grasping the hand that reaches 
down for us to save us. You even give us the strength and desire to grasp Your 
saving hand, O Lord.</p>
<p>Almighty One, I could thank You for many things, but two of 
them are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I want Your Spirit to fill me, so I choose to yield 
myself to You. May I find my strength in His power not my own. May Your Spirit 
empower me today.</p>
<p>King of kings, help me to become a more mature Christian. 
This does not happen in giant leaps, but by small and steady steps. Help me take 
those steps. I pray for some friends at church, that they might grow a little 
more every week: __________.</p>
<p>Father, I remember the nation of Mexico. Thank You that 
6.7% of the population claims to be born-again evangelical Christian, but 
somehow it seems that the number should be greater. Lord, please double that 
percentage within the next decade. The Mexican media portrays evangelicals as 
anti-Mexican spies and claims they are destroying Mexican culture. Yet the 
evangelical church is growing at a good clip. Father, keep working in this land; 
I pray for spiritual breakthroughs especially in Mexico City. May the many 
minorities hear the Gospel and may Your Spirit work mightily.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for the ministry of SAO Cambodia whose purpose is &quot;to 
assist church growth and to demonstrate and proclaim the reality of Christ's 
transforming love and His Lordship&quot; They seek to do this, &quot;through development 
projects and ministries, with a special focus on the poor and marginalized so as 
to see spiritual, physical, social and emotional healing and growth.&quot;</p>
<p>O Lord, empower, bless and provide for this ministry, I 
ask.</p>
<p>Help me to show the love of Christ to someone today, I 
pray in His Name, Amen.</p>
