<p><sup>13</sup> Is anyone of you in trouble?&nbsp; He should pray.&nbsp; Is anyone happy?&nbsp;
Let him sing songs of praise.&nbsp; <sup>14</sup> Is any one of you sick?&nbsp; He should
call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the
name of the Lord.&nbsp; <sup>15</sup> And the prayer offered in faith will make the
sick person well; the Lord will raise him up.&nbsp; If he has sinned, he will be
forgiven.&nbsp; <sup>16</sup> Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for
each other so that you may be healed.&nbsp; The prayer of a righteous man is powerful
and effective.</p>
