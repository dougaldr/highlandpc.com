up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the 
L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship 
me, <sup>14</sup> or this time I will send the 
full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people,

out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped 
you off the earth. <sup>16</sup> But I have 
raised you up  
for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be 
proclaimed in all the earth.</p>
