<br>How Ancient Biblical Judaism Keeps Us on Track
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>American history reflects a variety of alliances over the years. We
allied
with the English to fight the French and Indians, then we fought England for
our independence. In more recent years, we joined forces with Stalin's
Russia and then engaged in years of a Cold War with the same. Some of our
current allies are totalitarian Arab states. But not all strange alliances
are in the military realm. For example, if your theological views are like
mine, then you may have also noticed some strange alliances in the religious
realm.

<p>
Being an evangelical Christian who takes the Bible seriously gives me some
odd bedfellows. When it comes to some of the moral issues, like abortion,
I
find myself more closely aligned with the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox,
Mormon Church, and Orthodox Judaism than I do with liberal (mainline)
Protestants. When it comes to some matters of theology and practice, I find
my views closer to those of Orthodox Judaism than I do Roman Catholic and
Orthodox churches. And when it comes to a perspective about how believers
mature, I consider myself more closely aligned to the views of Old Testament
Judaism than I do to the views of evangelicalism's fastest growing wings.
</p>

<p>
Up until about 75 AD the majority of believers were Jewish. They had
tremendous Old Testament backgrounds and were a biblically-literate bunch.
They were serious about &quot;meditating day and night&quot; in the law of the Lord
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ps1.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Psalm 1</a>).&nbsp;
The Scriptures were studied (not just &quot;used&quot; but
studied) at
home and prayers were recited daily. That is one reason why so many Jews
accepted Christ on the Day of Pentecost: they had been primed with the
Scriptures over a lifetime. They memorized, they studied, and they
practiced.
</p>

<p>
As the gospel spread to the gentiles, non-Jews became the majority and the
church began to change. Rather than combating problems of legalism, such
as
we see in Galatians or Romans, the gentile congregations struggled with a
host of moral and theological confusion. (See Corinthians and Colossians.)&nbsp;
As Christianity moved away from its Jewish roots, it strayed
proportionately. For example, a Jewish believer would never have bowed
down
to a statue or icon; the second commandment was considered serious stuff. Dead saints would not have been called upon in prayer.&nbsp;
Omnipresence
belongs
to God alone, and giving another such an attribute is indeed an act of
worship. Only God is to be worshipped, and if prayer isn't worship, what
is?
</p>

<p>
The Lord's Supper can best be understood in the context of the Passover
Seder from which it was taken. The meaning and mode of baptism is based
upon its Jewish origin, a ritual immersion that cannot cleanse the soul but
is the formalization of repentance (or conversion).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Christ dying as our Passover Lamb on the Feast of Passover, rising
on the Feast of First Fruits, and sending His Spirit on the Feast of
Pentecost cannot be fully appreciated without understanding these Old
Testament holidays.
</p>

<p>
Only a few New Testament passages rival the clarity of
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/is53312.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Isaiah 53:3-12</a> when
addressing the nature of Christ's atoning work on the cross. Jews
understood the concept of &quot;leaning into&quot; a sacrifice; the priest would
press
his weight into the animal to signify a transfer of sin and the creation of
the substitute. What did Christ do on the cross? Our sins were
transferred
to him and he served as our substitute.
</p>

<p>
God ruled in the Old Testament through his Law. It was clear that
Scripture
was to be judge and jury of all: the priests, the prophets, even the judges
and kings&#151;no one was above the Law. In the New Testament, we see the
same
set-up: everyone, church leaders included, is held accountable to the Word
of God. The Law of God was above Israel; the Law of God is above the
Church. And this same emphasis&#151;constant attention to the Scripture&#151;is
still what makes healthy Christians and God-honoring churches.
</p>

<p>
Where am I going with all this? Well, here it is. When the church
hovers
close to her Jewish roots, when she takes her place as humbly drawing life
from the rootstock of Israel, she remains more closely aligned to the truth.&nbsp;
It was when Christianity lost its Old Testament moorings that it slid into
error. The church of even 250 AD was probably far removed from the church
of 75 AD, much like the United States of 2000 is very different from the USA
of 1825.
</p>

<p>
One reason I appreciate the Messianic Jewish movement is that this group
helps remind the rest of us about our spiritual roots. The church needs to
humbly acknowledge that what Christ said still stands, &quot;Salvation is of the
Jews.&quot; Our Jewish Savior and his Jewish apostles called out both Jew
and
gentile to become this &quot;sect of the Jews&quot; that we call the church.
</p>

<p>
No, God does not demand we gentiles eat kosher, keep the feasts, nor observe
Mosaic rituals. (See
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/acts15a.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 15</a>.).&nbsp;
But I do think He want us to appreciate our
spiritual roots and draw from them. As <b> Romans 11:18b</b> reads, &quot;You do
not
support the root, but the root supports you.&quot;
</p>

<p>
So I tip my hat to groups like the Messianic congregation, Simhat Yeshua,
and our own Jewish roots advocate, Sam Stevens. And I encourage you,
brothers and sisters, to read books like <i>Yeshua, A Guide to the Real Jesus
and the Original Church and Jesus, the Jewish Theologian</i>.
</p>

<p>
I also want to acknowledge the support and enthusiasm of our Board of Elders
and this congregation, year after year. At our recent Passover Seder
carry-in dinner, over one hundred of you participated, despite having to
prepare food from a different culture. As I looked over your faces, I
thought to myself, &quot;What a wonderful bunch of people we have here.&quot;&nbsp;
And we
do. There are many churches in our area, and frankly some of them have a
better &quot;this&quot; or are better at doing &quot;that,&quot; but few, if
any, do a better
job of connecting Christians to our Old Testament roots. And it is your
enthusiastic support, your quest to understand the Word of God, and your
open-mindedness that helps us lead the way. I take my hat off to you.&nbsp;
Shalom Elechem.
