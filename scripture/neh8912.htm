<p><sup>9</sup> Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the
Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, &quot;This day is
sacred to the L<span>ORD</span> your God. Do not mourn or weep.&quot; For all the people had
been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Nehemiah said, &quot;Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks,
and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our
Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the L<span>ORD</span> is your strength.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> The Levites calmed all the people, saying, &quot;Be still, for
this is a sacred day. Do not grieve.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send
portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood
the words that had been made known to them.</p>
