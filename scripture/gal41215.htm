<p><sup>12</sup> I plead with you, brothers, 
become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.
<sup>13</sup> As you know, it was because of an 
illness that I first preached the gospel to you.
<sup>14</sup> Even though my illness was a trial 
to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as 
if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
<sup>15</sup> What has happened to all your joy? 
I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes 
and given them to me.</p>
