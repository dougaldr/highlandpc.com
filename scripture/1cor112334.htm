<p><sup>23</sup> For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The
Lord Jesus , on the night he was betrayed, took bread, <sup>24</sup> and when he
had given thanks, he broke it and said, &quot;This is my body which is for you;
do this in remembrance of me.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>25</sup> In the same way, after supper
he took the cup, saying, &quot;This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do
this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>26</sup> For
whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death
until he comes.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord
in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of
the Lord.&nbsp; <sup>28</sup> A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the
bread and drinks of the cup.&nbsp; <sup>29</sup> For anyone who eats and drinks
without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.&nbsp;
<sup>30</sup>
That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen
asleep.&nbsp; <sup>31</sup> But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under&nbsp;
judgment.&nbsp; <sup>32</sup> When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined
so that we will not be condemned with the world.</p>

<p><sup>33</sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for
each other.&nbsp; <sup>34</sup> If anyone is hungry he should eat at home, so that
when you meet together it may not result in judgment.</p>

<p>And when I come I will give further directions.</p>
