<p><sup>16</sup> To the woman he said,</p>
<p>“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in pain you shall bring forth children.<br>
	Your desire shall be contrary to your husband,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he shall rule over you.”
<p><sup>17</sup> And to Adam he said,</p>
<p>“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have eaten of the tree<br>
	of which I commanded you,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You shall not eat of it,’<br>
	cursed is the ground because of you;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life;<br>
	<sup>18</sup> thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you;<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you shall eat the plants of the field.<br>
	<sup>19</sup> By the sweat of your face<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall eat bread,<br>
	till you return to the ground,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for out of it you were taken;<br>
	for you are dust,<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to dust you shall return.”</p>
