<p><sup>1</sup>Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the
brothers: &quot;Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by
Moses, you cannot be saved.&quot; <sup>2</sup>This brought Paul and Barnabas
into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed,
along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and
elders about this question.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup>Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of
the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? <sup>11</sup>No!
We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as
they are.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>19</sup>&quot;It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it
difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. <sup>20</sup>Instead we
should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from
sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. <sup>21</sup>For
Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the
synagogues on every Sabbath.&quot;</p>
