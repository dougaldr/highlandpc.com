<p><sup>19</sup> Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped
out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, <sup>20</sup> and that he
may send the Christ, who as been appointed for you&#151;even Jesus.&nbsp; <sup>21</sup> He
must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he
promised long ago through his holy prophets.</p>
