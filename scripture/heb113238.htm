<p><sup>32 </sup>And what more shall I say?&nbsp; I do not have time to tell about
Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets, <sup>33 </sup>who
through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was
promised; who shut the mouths of lions, <sup>34 </sup>quenched the fury of the
flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to
strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.&nbsp; <sup>35 </sup>Women
received back their dead, raised to life again.&nbsp; Others were tortured and refused
to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.&nbsp; <sup>36 </sup>Some
faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison.&nbsp;
<sup>37
</sup>They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the
sword.&nbsp; They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and
mistreated— <sup>38 </sup>the world was not worthy of them.&nbsp; They wandered in
deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.</p>
