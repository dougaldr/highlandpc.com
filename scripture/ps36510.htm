<p><sup>5</sup> Your love, O L<span>ORD</span>, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to
the skies.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup>  Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your
justice like the great deep.&nbsp; O L<span>ORD</span>, you preserve both man and beast.&nbsp;
<sup>7</sup>
How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge
in the shadow of your wings.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup>  They feast on the abundance of your
house; you give them drink form your river of delights.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> For with
you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup>  Continue
your love to those who know you, your righteousness to the upright in heart.</p>
