<p><sup>22</sup> Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with 
all his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years
<sup>23</sup> and saw the third generation of 
Ephraim's children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at 
birth on Joseph's knees. 
<p><sup>24</sup> Then Joseph said to his 
brothers, &quot;I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you 
up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob.&quot; <sup>25</sup> And Joseph made the sons of 
Israel swear an oath and said, &quot;God will surely come to your aid, and then you 
must carry my bones up from this place.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>26</sup> So Joseph died at the age of a 
hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in 
Egypt.</p>
