<p><sup>11</sup> Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth
and called &quot;uncircumcised&quot; by those who call themselves &quot;the
circumcision&quot; (that done in the body by the hands of men)&#151; <sup>12</sup>
remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from
citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenant of the promise, without
hope and without God in the world.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> But now in Christ Jesus you who
once were far way have been brought near through the blood of Christ.</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> For he himself is our peace who has made the two one, and has
destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility, <sup>15</sup> by
abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations.&nbsp; His
purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace, <sup>16</sup>
and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by
which he put to death their hostility.&nbsp; <sup>17</sup> He came and preached peace
to those who were near.&nbsp; <sup>18</sup> For through him we both have access to the
Father by one Spirit.</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but
fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household, <sup>20</sup>
built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with Christ Jesus
himself as the chief cornerstone.&nbsp; <sup>21</sup> In him the whole building is
joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.&nbsp; <sup>22</sup> And
in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives
by his Spirit.</p>
