<p><sup>20:45</sup> The word of the L<span>ORD</span> came to me:
<sup>46</sup> &quot;Son of man, set your face toward the south; 
preach against the south and prophesy against the forest of the southland.
<sup>47</sup> Say to the southern forest: 'Hear the word of 
the L<span>ORD</span> . This is what the Sovereign L<span>ORD</span> says: I am about to set fire to you, 
and it will consume all your trees, both green and dry. The blazing flame will 
not be quenched, and every face from south to north will be scorched by it.
<sup>48</sup> Everyone will see that I the L<span>ORD</span> have kindled 
it; it will not be quenched.' &quot; 
<p><sup>49</sup> Then I said, &quot;Ah, Sovereign L<span>ORD</span>! They 
are saying of me, 'Isn't he just telling parables?' &quot;</p>
<p><sup>21:1</sup> The word of the L<span>ORD</span> came to me: <sup>2</sup> &quot;Son of man, set 
your face against Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary. Prophesy against 
the land of Israel <sup>3</sup> and say to her: 'This is what 
the L<span>ORD</span> says: I am against you. I will draw my sword from its scabbard and cut 
off from you both the righteous and the wicked. <sup>4</sup> 
Because I am going to cut off the righteous and the wicked, my sword will be 
unsheathed against everyone from south to north. <sup>5</sup> 
Then all people will know that I the L<span>ORD</span> have drawn my sword from its scabbard; 
it will not return again.' 
<p><sup>6</sup> &quot;Therefore groan, son of man! Groan before 
them with broken heart and bitter grief. <sup>7</sup> And when 
they ask you, 'Why are you groaning?' you shall say, 'Because of the news that 
is coming. Every heart will melt and every hand go limp; every spirit will 
become faint and every knee become as weak as water.' It is coming! It will 
surely take place, declares the Sovereign L<span>ORD</span> .&quot; </p>
