<br>Men of God, Not Just Persons of God: A Taste of Our Men's Meetings
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>I have recently read a couple of books, written by angry 
Christian men who lash out at the church for its feminizing ways. Although 
these guys have no doubt felt stifled and as though they have now have broken 
free, they are spewing forth reactionary responses rather than nailing the 
problem with the hammer of truth.</p>
<p>The truth is that many churches ARE feminizing in nature. 
This is especially true within the liberal mainlines with their feminist 
agendas; it is true within Catholicism by virtue of its celibate priesthood; and 
it has been true within <i>some</i> evangelical churches. </p>
<p>In my mind, I ask why a masculine man would even mess with 
a feminizing church in the first place, especially in locations where there are 
many evangelical churches to choose from? The weak enslave themselves. The 
problem, then, is not that churches are churning out men who will not assert 
themselves: the problem is that so many men are already nonassertive to the 
point that they tolerate about anything, including feminizing churches. It 
reminds me of a person moving to Alaska and then complaining that it is cold.</p>
<p>When reactionaries write, &quot;The church today is this way...&quot; 
or &quot;The church today needs this...,&quot; I ask myself, &quot;What is 'the church?'&quot; By 
&quot;the&quot; church, do we mean the universal church? If so, who could speak for this 
church other than its head, Jesus Christ Himself? Do we mean the evangelical 
church? Who, then, is its spokesperson? If one has dependable statistics from 
someone like pollster George Barna, for example, one might be able to say, &quot;<i>most</i> 
evangelical churches.&quot; But not, &quot;the church.&quot; Since these authors have no 
statistics, what they should say is, &quot;The churches with which I am familiar.&quot;
</p>
<p>To label &quot;the church&quot; as feminizing because Joe Schmo was 
brought up in such a church is unfair to other churches that may not be guilty 
of such abuse. Setting up straw men is a tried and true way to persuade without 
facts, figures, and statistics. Straw men cannot fight back, nor can they 
defend themselves against inaccurate statements and lies.</p>
<p>The Bible-emphasizing churches I have known best have 
always been pro-masculine and have sometimes been condemned because of it! They 
preach the whole counsel of God, so their Jesus is not the nice, feminized 
Jesus, but, instead, the Jesus who died for us because He loved us AND the Jesus 
who also trashed the Temple Courts on two occasions, provoked by His holy 
anger. When it comes to relations within marriage, the Bible is unblushingly 
clear that this is important and should be regular and frequent 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1cor735.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>), 
and Bible-intensive churches teach this (discreetly).</p>
<p>In the Word, godly men are pictured as hunters, warriors, 
and anything but wimps. The Bible is filled with battles and stories of brave 
men who trusted God as they defended their land. Even God Himself is called a 
&quot;warrior&quot; 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ex153.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Exodus 15:3</a>). 
These solid, Bible-intensive churches never present 
Jesus as a &quot;lover&quot; to fill in as a husband substitute.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I would love to see a controlled study contrasting 
congregations with a higher than average male attendance, like ours, to churches 
in which males are relatively scarce (in some churches, females outnumber males 
4 to 1). I would be fascinated to see the theological differences, the 
preaching style, leadership expectations, and service (&quot;worship style&quot;) format. 
That would be most revealing.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be a &quot;man of God&quot; in contrast to a 
&quot;person of God?&quot; Here are my opinions in a nutshell. Men of God take <i>
initiative</i>, protect their families, challenge irrational thinking, and can 
handle it if their wives are angry; they are willing to compromise and very much 
concerned about others. They communicate what they are thinking and choose not 
to be afraid of their wives. (Most, not all, men are afraid of looking bad to 
their wives and so agree verbally but later renege.). They can be tender and 
sensitive, but they can also be tough and bold. They make no apologies for what 
they enjoy (unless condemned in Scripture). They make no apologies for their 
inability to divide their attention as women can: when they are reading the 
paper, the rest of the world doesn't exist. So be it.</p>
<p>Not all men are alike, nor should they be: some are 
introverted, some extroverted. Some like to cook while others prefer playing 
football. There are Jacobs and there are Esaus. But good churches have never 
apologized for men being men, and wise women do not try to feminize them. 
Although all of us guys need to be civilized (and to civilize our sons, 
including teaching them manners and courtesies), we should recognize that God 
wants us to be men of God, not just &quot;persons&quot; of God. A godly man and a godly 
woman may have a lot in common, but they value different qualities. Paul wrote 
to the Corinthian men, &quot;Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of 
courage; be strong&quot; (<b>1 Corinthians 16:13</b>). The ability to take a firm, unapologetic 
stand, to take courage, and to embrace strength rather than fearing it or 
looking at strength as evil might serve as a summary of what it means to be 
masculine.</p>
<p>Yet Paul tempers his advice in <b>verse 14</b>, &quot;Do everything in 
love.&quot; Our wives and children will more likely respect our masculinity if we are 
out for their best interests. &nbsp;Selfish masculinity is still masculinity, but not 
the kind a Christian should want! Biblical masculinity may be bold, but it is 
not selfish. Yet, on the other hand, it is not manipulated by <i>claims</i> of 
selfishness. Bible-oriented men recognize that <i>both</i> men and women are 
equally sinful. They do not attempt to convince their wives of this! Instead, 
Biblically masculine men honestly examine their hearts and ask the opinions of 
other godly men. </p>
<p>When we get serious about studying and applying the Bible, 
we find that we will respect and cater to BOTH genders. </p>
<p>Men, as a footnote, let me encourage you to 
participate in our monthly &quot;Men's Meeting&quot; on selected Sunday nights. We are 
NOT out to feminize you. We are out to encourage a godly masculinity. Join us 
October 30<sup>th</sup> and November 27<sup>th </sup>at 6:30 pm!</p>
<p>Ladies, I have a footnote for you: at the same dates and 
times above, join Janie Martin, Debbie Pemberton, and Lorrie Cabush as they lead 
our &quot;Women's Meeting.&quot; Addressing gender-specific concerns is part of why we 
meet!</p>
