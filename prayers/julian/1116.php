<p>Dear Lord,</p>
<p>You are a great God: grand, majestic, peerless, glorious, universally 
acclaimed and completely noble. You surpass our understanding and transcend our 
logic. Nonetheless, everything about You makes sense. Just as an infant cannot 
understand nuclear physics, so we cannot understand You. But because we cannot 
understand does not imply that You are not reasonable, consistent or logical—for 
You are. You are simply too awesome for us, too great for us to fathom. Our 
minds cannot grasp Your infinite nature or Your infinite attributes.</p>
<p>Father, create a hunger in me—a hunger for Your Word. Sometimes my spiritual 
appetite is sated because I have filled it with junk food. Sometimes my heart is 
focused elsewhere. You consider Your Word such a priority that You put it on a 
par with Your Name, for the Psalmist wrote in <b>Psalm 138:2b</b>, &quot;for you have 
exalted above all things your name and your word.&quot; O Lord, may I agree with this 
opinion of Your Word, and may I take its study seriously.</p>
<p>God, sometimes I struggle with doubts: doubts about You, Your love for me, 
Your Word, or my salvation. But my doubts can be good. They can drive me to find 
answers, they help me empathize with the doubts of others and they spur me on to 
think more deeply. Remind me that faith is choosing to believe despite my 
doubts. Like the man who asked Jesus to heal his son, I too say, &quot;I do believe; 
help me overcome my unbelief!&quot; (<b>Mark 9:24</b>). So help me not to deny my 
doubts but to address them.</p>
<p>Father, You have done a great work in South Korea. Nearly 16% of the 
population is made up of born-again evangelical Christians. Ten of the eleven 
largest churches in the world are in Korea's capital, Seoul. Korea is second 
only to the U.S. in the number of missionaries it has sent out. We pray that the 
growth and success of the Korean church would continue forward and that more 
people would come to know Christ. O Father, may the materialism that has taken 
over the American church and now threatens the Korean church be held at bay. 
Help the believers to hold high moral standards and speak out against 
corruption. I pray that Your Spirit would protect and multiply the Korean 
Church. </p>
<p>Today I remember AMG International, &quot;an evangelical mission and relief agency 
currently ministering in 55 countries of the world.&quot; Their mission is &quot;to give 
each person at least one opportunity to hear and respond to the gospel.&quot; Bless 
their efforts and empower them with Your Spirit as they &quot;endeavor to meet people 
at the point of their need whether it be hunger, sickness, or hopelessness and 
show them Jesus as the only answer to the problems of this life and the only 
hope for eternal life.&quot; Grant them harmony amongst themselves and provide for 
their needs bountifully, I ask.</p>
<p>Now help me be on the lookout for opportunities to minister Jesus Christ to 
others, I ask in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
