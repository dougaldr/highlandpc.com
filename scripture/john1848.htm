<p><sup>4</sup> Jesus, knowing all that was going 
to happen to him, went out and asked them, &quot;Who is it you want?&quot; </p>
<p><sup>5</sup> &quot;Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; they 
replied. </p>
<p>&quot;I am he,&quot; Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with 
them.) <sup>6</sup> When Jesus said, &quot;I am he,&quot; 
they drew back and fell to the ground. </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> Again he asked them, &quot;Who is it 
you want?&quot; <br>And they said, &quot;Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>8</sup> &quot;I told you that I am he,&quot; Jesus 
answered. &quot;If you are looking for me, then let these men go.&quot;</p>
