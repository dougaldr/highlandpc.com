<p><sup>9</sup> That if you confess with your 
mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the 
dead, you will be saved. <sup>10</sup> For it is 
with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth 
that you confess and are saved. <sup>11</sup> As 
the Scripture says, &quot;Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.&quot;
<sup>12</sup> For there is no difference between 
Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on 
him, <sup>13</sup> for, &quot;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&quot;</p>
