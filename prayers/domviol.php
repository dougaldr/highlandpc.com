  <p>Dear Father in Heaven,
  <p>Lord, the term Father paints a beautiful picture for us.  But for some,
  terms like mother, father, sister, or brother are not positive terms. 
  Father, so many people suffer the effects of domestic violence.  The home,
  which is meant to be a shelter from the harsh world out there is sometimes
  the most dangerous place to be.  We know this grieves Your heart.
  <p>Lord, you intended marriage and family to be among the greatest blessings
  of life.  We praise and thank You that such is often the case.  But our
  hearts bleed for those who do not know a safe haven at home.   We know that
  violence traumatizes us so much that we are never the same.  The scars run
  deep.
  <p>The issues involved are many and complicated, but the nature of our 
  request is not.
  <p>Our God, we ask you to help those who are victims of violence.  We pray
  that you would help restore their sense of value and dignity. We ask you to
  help those who are trapped in a cycle of violence.  We ask you to help them 
  address their frustrations and anger in appropriate ways.  We pray that we 
  would not only be concerned about ourselves, but that we would consider the
  impact of our behavior upon others.  We pray for your wisdom and direction 
  for those persons and agencies that seek to aid, counsel, and nurture
  victims of violence.
  <p>We pray that all of our homes would become safe havens of love and
  support.
  <p>For we pray in Jesus’ Name, Amen</p>
