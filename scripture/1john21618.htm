<p><sup>16</sup> For everything in the world&#151;the cravings of sinful man, the
lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does&#151;comes not from the
Father but from the world.&nbsp; <sup>17</sup> The world and its desires pass away,
but the man who does the will of God lives forever.&nbsp; <sup>18</sup> Dear children,
this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even
now many antichrists have come.&nbsp; This is ho we know it is the last hour.</p>
