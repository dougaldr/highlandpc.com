<br>Praise for Life
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Yahweh, L<span class="sm">ORD</span> of the universe, how I praise you for giving me breath and
another day of life. Your gift of life is taken for granted by us all, and it is
only during those rare, thankful moments that we appreciate the privilege of
being alive, the privilege of being human. So often we use our humanity as an
excuse, not as grounds for praise. I praise you for making me &quot;me.&quot;&nbsp;
Though part of my nature is sinful, I am still in your image. And, because of my
salvation, I am the dwelling place for your Spirit. Thank you for my humanity.&nbsp;
Thank you for my senses. Thank you I can enjoy culture, art, music, and the
beauty of the flowers and trees.</p>
<p>Father, I likewise praise you for giving me friends and family. This is a
lonely world, and ultimately I remember that it can never, in some ways, be more
than you and I. No one else can enter into my very soul, know my every feeling,
and be with me wherever I go, whatever circumstances surround me. But I thank
you for those who empathize with me, who love me as family or friend, who pray
for my best interest. And thank you that I am not merely on the receiving end,
for your Son said, &quot;It is more blessed to give than to receive.&quot;&nbsp;
Thank
you for the people I love. Thank you that often my love for others and their
love for me is mutual. And thank you for those I love in the name of Jesus who
may choose not to return my love. Thank you that you see and will reward me in
glory.</p>
<p>I bless your name for you have placed me in a free land. Though our society
is corrupt in many ways, it also provides my loved ones and me with a degree of
comfort, safety, and freedom. Thank you for my country. Please guide our
leaders, legislators, and public servants. Please renew our family units that we
may begin to reassemble the pieces of our fragmented society. Stem the divorce
tide, help the single parents, and especially help the empty and devastated
children of divorced and unstable families. Lord, your Word tells us that you
have a special love for the children. Surely your heart is broken.</p>
<p>O Lord, our Lord, encourage me, strengthen me, motivate me. Constantly fill
me with your Spirit. Help me see how I grieve and limit him and give me the
resolve to refuse to continue grieving the Divine Comforter.</p>
<p>Father, graciously bless those who truly serve you in ministry. Encourage the
demoralized pastors and keep them from experiencing burnout. Help them to say no
to the many demands made upon them so they might have time and energy to say yes
to your perfect will. Convict them if they seek to please people rather than to
freely follow you. Help them be slaves of Jesus Christ and not slaves to those
who reward or punish with their words or attitudes. Give spiritual fruit and
material provision to those who truly share the Gospel and have crossed cultures
to do so. Provide protection for them, and guide them as they seek to rear
families in unfamiliar environments. Remind us, through your Spirit, to support
those who have perhaps the highest of all callings&#151;the call to missions.</p>
<p>Great God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, help me submit myself to you.&nbsp;
Show me the ugliness of my sin. Help me see how I come across to others, and,
because of my love for others, help me care how I am viewed. May I not be less
than authentic, but help me balance my authenticity with sensitivity.</p>
<p>Thank you that you will be at work in us till you call us to glory. For we
pray in Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
