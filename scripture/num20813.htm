<p><sup>8</sup> "Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the 
assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out 
its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they 
and their livestock can drink."</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> So Moses took the staff from the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>'s presence, just as he 
commanded him. <sup>10</sup> He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of 
the rock and Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels, must we bring you 
water out of this rock?" <sup>11</sup> Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock 
twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their 
livestock drank.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> But the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you 
did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the 
Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them."</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites 
quarreled with the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> and where he showed himself holy among them.</p>
