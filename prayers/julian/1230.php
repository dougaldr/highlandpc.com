<p>Lord,</p>
<p>Your Word tells me, &quot;Cursed is everyone who trusts in man, 
who depends on the flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the 
Lord&quot; (<b>Jeremiah 17:5</b>). Lord, You want to be the source of my strength; You want 
me to learn to depend upon You; You want me to turn my heart toward You, not 
away from You.</p>
<p>Father, Your desire for me is completely reasonable. You 
encourage me, &quot;But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence 
is in him&quot; (<b>Jeremiah 17:7</b>). Lord, I can understand this principle; it is not 
only reasonable, but also easy to grasp.</p>
<p>Yet, Lord, I admit that I am predisposed against this. 
Because my &quot;heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure&quot; (<b>Jeremiah 
17:9</b>), I find that I am often a divided person. </p>
<p>On the one hand, I want to depend upon You and walk closely 
with You; on the other hand, I am afraid to trust in You and would rather trust 
in what my eyes can see or what I have determined in myself. And when You 
haven't give me my way, I find it easy to put distance between You and myself; 
it is my subconscious attempt to protest that I do not like some of the things 
You do or allow. I will not face that I am doing this, because my deceitful 
heart will not let me see how ugly I am. But then I realize we are not as close 
as we used to be and Your Spirit focuses His spotlight on the evil within me.</p>
<p>Like Paul the Apostle, I cry out, &quot;What a wretched man I 
am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?&quot; But like Paul, I also cry out 
with joy, &quot;Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!&quot; (<b>Romans 7:24-25</b>).</p>
<p>My King, I remember the island of Sulawesi, part of the 
nation of Indonesia. This island is home to over 15 million people with its 
great variety of people groups. Thank You that about 16% of the population might 
identify themselves as born-again evangelicals. But, Lord, there are so many 
who do not know You! In addition, there are somewhere between 30 and 110 
language groups which do not have a Bible in their native tongues.</p>
<p>An additional challenge is the problem of violent 
confrontations between language groups. O God, bring peace, freedom and, most 
of all, Your Gospel to this entire island! May the number of believers double 
over the next decade, I ask.</p>
<p>Lord, today I remember in prayer all the true ministers of 
the Gospel within a 50-mile radius of my home. O God, grant them protection, 
provision, harmony within their own families, within their churches and, most 
importantly, in their relationship to You. Keep them true to Your Word, correct 
them, empower them and give them hearts devoted to You, I ask. Grant them great 
wisdom and give them fruit for their labors.</p>
<p>I commit these last two days of the year to Your glory, in 
the Savior's Name, Amen.</p>
