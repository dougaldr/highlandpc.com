<p><sup>14:</sup><sup>5</sup>One man considers one day more sacred than another;
another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his
own mind. <sup>6</sup>He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He
who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who
abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God. <sup>7</sup>For none of
us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone. <sup>8</sup>If
we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we
live or die, we belong to the Lord.<br>
<sup>9</sup>For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he
might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. <sup>10</sup>You, then, why
do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will
all stand before God's judgment seat.</p>

<p><sup>14:12</sup>So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.<br>
<sup>13</sup>Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead,
make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's
way.</p>

<p><sup>14:19</sup>Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace
and to mutual edification.</p>

<p><sup>15:1</sup>We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak
and not to please ourselves. <sup>2</sup>Each of us should please his neighbor
for his good, to build him up. <sup>3</sup>For even Christ did not please
himself but, as it is written: &quot;The insults of those who insult you have
fallen on me.&quot; <sup>4</sup>For everything that was written in the past was
written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the
Scriptures we might have hope.<br>
<sup>5</sup>May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit
of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus, <sup>6</sup>so that with
one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<sup>7</sup>Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to
bring praise to God.</p>
