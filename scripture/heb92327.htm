<p><sup>23</sup> It was necessary, then, for the copies of the 
heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things 
themselves with better sacrifices than these. <sup>24</sup> For Christ did not enter
a manmade sanctuary that was only a
copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's
presence.&nbsp; <sup>25</sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and
again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood
that is not his own.&nbsp; <sup>26</sup> Then Christ would have had to suffer many
times since the creation of the world.&nbsp; But now he has appeared once for all at
the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup>
Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.</p>
