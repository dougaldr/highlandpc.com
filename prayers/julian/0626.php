<p>Dear Great God,</p>
<p>When You sent Israel the bread from heaven, they ate of the 
manna day after day. From this, we learn that You are the God Who provides our 
daily means and You are not limited by nature. You spoke the word and the 
Israelites could sustain their lives. Those sweet bread flakes kept the children 
of Israel healthy and full. So we must learn that we do not live by bread 
alone, but by every word that proceeds from Your mouth. And even the bread we 
do eat is by Your grace and provision. You are the God Who provides.</p>
<p>Lord, it is sometimes frustrating to know how to deal with 
people. Some people are sincere, open and forthcoming; others are deceptive, 
dishonest and manipulating; yet others are so tightlipped that I have no idea 
what is really going on. On the one hand, You want me to make an effort to 
encourage or help those who are on the level and open to truth; on the other 
hand, You warn me not to waste my time by casting my pearls before the swine. 
Please, Lord, give me discernment when it comes to determining where I should 
place my efforts.</p>
<p>I pray for my lost friends and family members, including: __________. 
Father, please send Your Spirit to draw them to Yourself and grant&nbsp;them the 
repentance that leads to life.</p>
<p>I pray for Christians who are straying from their first 
love or compromising their walk with You. Rekindle the faith they once 
professed and help them fervently love the Savior once again. Remove their 
boring view of serving You and help them see the adventure and fulfillment of 
walking daily in Your light. Stir up their hearts and help them make the 
routines of godliness a part of their lives. I especially remember: __________.</p>
<p>Abba, I pray for the Pacific island nation of New 
Caledonia. Thank You that 7.5% of the population claim to be born-again 
evangelical Christians. May that number double over the next decade, I ask. 
Bless the seven Bible translation efforts that are ongoing among these language 
groups and provide survey and translators for the other twenty-one if that is Your 
will, O Lord. May the Christian churches that have strayed away from the faith 
of the Bible begin to return.</p>
<p>Praise Your Name for the 
ministry of Every Child Ministries (ECM). Lord, I know children are precious and 
close to Your heart; this ministry must therefore be especially precious to 
You. ECM &quot;emphasizes showing the love of Jesus to the 
neediest of African children in practical ways and using African nationals to 
train their own people. ECM shows love of Jesus through mercy ministries to 
homeless street children, through seeking to release and retrain slave children 
and through medical and rehabilitation ministries to the sick and handicapped.&quot; 
They &quot;also train African leaders and churches to teach children and youth.&quot; O 
Lord, provide for this ministry, protect them, empower them by Your Spirit and 
grant them great success in these areas! Also give them harmony amongst 
themselves.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to 
experience Your peace that passes all understanding today. When I feel hemmed in 
from all sides, remind me to look up toward You, I pray, in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
