<p><sup>3</sup> When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he 
proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened 
Bread. <sup>4</sup> After arresting him, he put him in prison, 
handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod 
intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. 
<p><sup>5</sup> So Peter was kept in prison, but the church 
was earnestly praying to God for him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> The night before Herod was to bring him to 
trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and 
sentries stood guard at the entrance. <sup>7</sup> Suddenly an 
angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the 
side and woke him up. “Quick, get up!” he said, and the chains fell off Peter's 
wrists. </p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Then the angel said to him, “Put on your 
clothes and sandals.” And Peter did so. “Wrap your cloak around you and follow 
me,” the angel told him. <sup>9</sup> Peter followed him out of 
the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really 
happening; he thought he was seeing a vision. <sup>10</sup> They 
passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the 
city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had 
walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him. </p>
