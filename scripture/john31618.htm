<p><sup>16</sup> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&nbsp; <sup>17</sup>
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save
the world through him.&nbsp; <sup>18</sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not
believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of
God's one and only Son.</p>
