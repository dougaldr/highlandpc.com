<p><sup>24</sup> For Christ did not enter a manmade sanctuary that was only a
copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's
presence.&nbsp; <sup>25</sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and
again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood
that is not his own.&nbsp; <sup>26</sup> Then Christ would have had to suffer many
times since the creation of the world.&nbsp; But now he has appeared once for all at
the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup>
Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, <sup>28</sup>
so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will
appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are
waiting for him.</p>
