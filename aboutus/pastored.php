<p>Pastor Ed was reared in the Chicago area. He became a born-again
believer in January 1974 during his senior year of high school when a
friend who worked on the school newspaper shared the Gospel with Ed. Although he
was raised Roman Catholic and knew many of the facts of the Gospel, he came to
realize that he could not get to heaven by proper behavior. It was through the
work of Christ alone that he could be made right with God. All he had to do was
hold God to His Word. God promised eternal life to those who put their faith in
Christ, and Ed took Him up on the offer!</p>

<p>Although Ed did not know his future wife, Marylu, at the time, a few months
earlier in the fall of 1973 friends at work shared the Good News with her.&nbsp;
She read Billy Graham's book <i>Peace With God</i> and also trusted in the
work of Christ alone for her salvation.</p>

<p>When it came to career choices, Ed was interested in journalism,
but it was a difficult field in which to find a job. He decided to pursue his
second choice, electronics. As Ed was completing his Associates of Applied
Science degree in Electronics, he sensed a definite
call into the pastoral ministry. He completed his electronics degree in the
spring of 1976 and began Pastoral Studies at Moody Bible Institute that fall. He
graduated with a B.A. from Moody in the spring of 1979 and, at the age of 22,
took his first pastorate, Victory Bible Church of Chicago.</p>

<p>Ed pastored the Victory Bible Church for four and a half years.&nbsp;
It was during this time that Ed began dating and then married Marylu Troppito.&nbsp;
Ed and Marylu moved to Kokomo in late 1983, where Ed assumed the pastorate here
at Highland Park Church. Since that time, Ed and Marylu have been blessed with
two children, Hannah and Luke.</p>

<p>Marylu graduated from Northern Illinois University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts 
degree with pottery as her specialty. She then took a
one-year course at Moody Bible Institute geared for college graduates at that
time called the Advanced Studies Program. She still does some pottery 
and other artwork, but she is mainly occupied by her job as a paraprofessional 
in the Kokomo School Corporation. Ed and Marylu enjoy ballroom 
dancing.</p>

<p>As a result of their exposure to many ethnic groups, the Vasiceks often sampled 
cuisine from around the world. Marylu was the main cook in the family for about 27 
years, while Ed cooked soups and stews on weekends. But when Marylu began working 
as a teacher's aide, Ed offered to take over the meal prep. Since then, his cooking 
skills and interest have exploded. Since Ed has a heart stent, cooking is always 
low cholesterol.</p>

<p>Since 1999, Ed has authored a weekly editorial, which appears on 
the Opinion Page of the <i>Kokomo Tribune</i> and is mostly secular in nature. 
Over 500 of his columns addressing numerous issues have been published. Ed puts it 
this way: "My goal in writing these articles is to demonstrate that Christians can 
think about <i>many</i> things, not just abortion or gay marriage. Christians need to 
demonstrate that we have positive ideas and a cohesive philosophy of life&#0151;proposing 
ideas rather than just opposing. This can help create a positive environment for 
discussing the claims of Christ."  His community involvement includes serving on the
Board of Directors for the Kokomo Park Band.</p>

<p>Ed has a number of hobbies, including reading, cooking, 
collecting remakes of 1920s and 30s music, stamp collecting, and jokes.  He confesses 
to being a Three Stooges fan. On the serious side, Ed tries to stay abreast of the 
latest theological trends and challenges to the faith. Checkout Ed's personal 
website: <a href="http://edvasicek.tripod.com/" target="offline" class="reg">Ed Vasicek's Oasis: From the Heart & Head of Ed</a>.</p>

<p>Ed's ministries in the church include typical pastoral work: preaching, teaching, 
counseling, weddings, funerals, visitation, administration, etc. Ed is also 
noted for his puppet ministry and flannelgraph lessons.  He serves on the Camp 
Council for Camp Emmanuel and populates the church's website with articles.</p>

<p>Marylu serves the church in a supportive role: teaching Beginners' Sunday 
School and children's church, serving as an AWANA leader, organizing camp meals, and offering 
a listening ear to the women of the church. Together, Ed and Marylu lead the 
Summer Youth Program.</p>

<p>The Vasiceks tried to live out their faith at home. The Vasiceks typically 
prayed together as a family when the children resided at home, and Ed and Marylu 
still pray together. Their two adult children are walking with the Lord and are 
very involved in ministry.</p>
