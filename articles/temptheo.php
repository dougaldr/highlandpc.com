<br>Temperament Theory
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Tim LaHaye made temperament theory popular in the evangelical world in the
early 1970's when he wrote <u>Spirit-Controlled Temperament</u>. LaHaye
revived a temperament theory first proposed by the father of physicians,
Hippocrates himself. Hippocrates, who lived around 400 B.C., suggested
that the four temperaments were caused by excesses in bodily fluids, such as
phlegm, bile, etc. His list of personality types has fared well over the
centuries.</p>
<p>Many modern management specialists, counselors, etc., still think his four
divisions of personality types have merit. I am among them. But
figuring out an individual's personality type is not that simple. Although
some folks are heavily weighted toward one personality type, and thus easy to
peg, most of us are combinations, although one type usually prevails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These four personality types go by many names, and some modern analysts even
use animal names. I'll list those originally named by Hippocrates with
alternate terms given in parenthesis.</p>
<p>The first two temperaments are considered extroverted. First we find
the <b>Choleric</b> (doer, achiever, dominator, controllers, go-getter), the
type of person that gets things done and makes decisions but hates detail and
struggles with impatience. Cholerics make great high-level executives,
businessmen, foremen, and entrepreneurs. Cholerics love to hear the bottom
line information first and like measurable results. In the Christian
world, Cholerics often favor Mark's Gospel because it is short, to the point,
and action-oriented. They tend to see love as good deeds done or ministry
projects completed. Deborah, King Saul, and Nehemiah are Biblical examples
of a Choleric. Recent presidents noted for this personality: L.B.
Johnson, Richard Nixon. Key words: achievement, pro-activity.</p>
<p>The second extroverted temperament is the <b>Sanguine</b> (influencer,
risk-taker, entertainer, motivator, feeler, and life of the party). This
personality is often very inspiring, is sometimes described as having
&quot;charisma,&quot; is winsome and convincing. They make excellent
salespersons or seek out occupations providing variety, excitement, or frequent
change. Sanguines bring life and enthusiasm with them. On the
negative side, they can be shallow, vacillating, and display a nasty temper.&nbsp;
In the Christian world, Sanguines often favor John's Gospel with its emphasis on
love and tend to view love as a feeling. &quot;From the heart&quot; is a
key Sanguine term. They may also become critical of other personality
types, criticizing them as &quot;lukewarm.&quot; Sanguines who are blended
with another personality type (who are both excited and faithful, for example)
are special servants in the Kingdom of God. Simon Peter and Sarah are
examples of the Sanguine temperament. Recent president noted for this
personality: George W. Bush. Key words: passion (feeling), experiences.</p>
<p><b>Phlegmatics</b> (relaters, loyalists, steadies, laid back) may be somewhat
introverted before groups, but are often cheerful and gifted conversationalists
when placed in one-on-one settings or in &quot;safe&quot; groups, such as a
classroom. Phlegmatics are noted for their sensibility, stability,
understanding of people, and enjoyment of routine. They are often
exceptional listeners. Negatively, unless they develop good routines, they
are tempted toward laziness and procrastination. They may be overly
cautious. Career-wise, Phlegmatics gravitate toward teaching grade school,
counseling, or a steady routine work. In the church world, Phlegmatics
tend to see love as maintaining good relationships and being there for others
when needed. They are the types of people who can teach the same Sunday
School class for 25 years and be proud of it, just the opposite of Sanguines in
this regard. Their favorite Gospel is usually Luke, with its emphasis on
people. Abigail and Barnabas are Biblical examples of this relational
personality. Recent president with this personality: Ronald Reagan.&nbsp;
Key words: relationships, loyalty.</p>
<p>The fourth personality type is usually the most introverted, the <b>Melancholic</b>
(thinker, analyzer, and perfectionist). Melancholics value quality and
order. They make great surgeons, dentists, engineers, negotiators,
philosophers/intellectuals, legal secretaries, or accountants. They are
sometimes falsely accused of being cold, when, in reality, many Melancholics are
merely quiet. Melancholics often have deep compassion, but they are shy
about expressing their emotions. Of all personality types, they are the
most misunderstood. Negatively, Melancholics can be perfectionist and
idealistic.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Christian world, Melancholics often show
love by being thoughtful, kind, and serving in low-key, behind-the-scene areas
of ministry. Others use their artistic/musical talents to honor Christ.&nbsp;
They prefer the Gospel of Matthew because it is systematically arranged.&nbsp;
Mary, the mother of Jesus, who &quot;quietly pondered these things in her
heart&quot; is an example of a melancholic, as is Moses. Recent president
noted with this personality: Jimmy Carter. Key words: truth, consistency,
and justice.</p>
<p>Since most of us are combinations of these personalities, we are usually of
more modest disposition. This means we have both the strengths and
weaknesses of these personality types to a lesser degree. You can see how
we need one another to &quot;even and mellow&quot; us out. Unfortunately,
the tendency is for birds of a feather to flock together. We tend to exalt
our own personality type and look down upon those who differ.</p>
<p>Unlike grade school teachers, who are usually Phlegmatic, or salespersons,
who are usually Sanguine, pastors are pretty much evenly divided across the
spectrum. Your pastor is about 60% Phlegmatic with splatterings of each of
the other personality types.</p>
<p>Our Highland Park Church population is dominated by Phlegmatics and
Melancholics, but significantly enhanced by a number of key Sanguines and
Cholerics. Part of Body Life is learning to accept and respect one
another, contributing our individual strengths and compensating for individual
weaknesses. Being aware of these differences helps us work together
better. As we view the pros and cons of our own personalities, we can focus upon
areas in which we need growth. For most of us, that means moving in toward
the middle.</p>
<p>But many questions remain. Do different temperament types dominate a
society in a given generation? Where are the trends heading? Where
does temperament come from? How does our temperament affect our perception
of what love is? How much about ourselves and others should we try to
change, and how much should we accept? Sounds like good fodder for future
articles!
