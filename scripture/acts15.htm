<p><sup>1</sup> Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the
brothers: &quot;Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by
Moses, you cannot be saved.&quot; <sup>2</sup> This brought Paul and Barnabas
into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed,
along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and
elders about this question.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of
the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear? <sup>11</sup> No!
We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as
they are.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> &quot;It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it
difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. <sup>20</sup> Instead we
should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from
sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. <sup>21</sup> For
Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the
synagogues on every Sabbath.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>22</sup> Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their 
own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas 
(called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers.
<sup>23</sup> With them they sent the following 
letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in 
Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings. <sup>24</sup> We 
have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed 
you, troubling your minds by what they said. <sup>25</sup> So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear 
friends Barnabas and Paul— <sup>26</sup> men who 
have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<sup>27</sup> Therefore we are sending Judas and 
Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
<sup>28</sup> It seemed good to the Holy Spirit 
and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:
<sup>29</sup> You are to abstain from food 
sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from 
sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>30</sup> The men were sent off and went 
down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the 
letter. <sup>31</sup> The people read it and were 
glad for its encouraging message. <sup>32</sup> Judas 
and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen 
the brothers. <sup>33</sup> After spending some 
time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to 
return to those who had sent them.
<sup>35</sup> But Paul and Barnabas remained in 
Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.</p>
<p><sup>36</sup> Some time later Paul said to 
Barnabas, &quot;Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we 
preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.&quot;
<sup>37</sup> Barnabas wanted to take John, also 
called Mark, with them, <sup>38</sup> but Paul 
did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and 
had not continued with them in the work. <sup>39</sup> They 
had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and 
sailed for Cyprus, <sup>40</sup> but Paul chose 
Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
<sup>41</sup> He went through Syria and Cilicia, 
strengthening the churches.</p>
