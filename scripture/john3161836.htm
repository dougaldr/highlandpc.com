<p><sup>16</sup> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not
believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of
God's one and only Son.</p>

<p><sup>36</sup> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever
rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.</p>
