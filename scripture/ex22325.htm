<p><sup>23</sup> During that long period, the 
king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and 
their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
<sup>24</sup> God heard their groaning and he 
remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
<sup>25</sup> So God looked on the Israelites and 
was concerned about them.</p>
