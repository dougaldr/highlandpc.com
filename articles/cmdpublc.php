<br>The 10 Commandments and Prayer in the Public Arena
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<div>
  <p>Thanksgiving is around the
  corner. It is a great time to teach our children about the Christian
  convictions of the Pilgrims, about people starting life in a strange and
  dangerous land so they could serve God according to His leading. The
  spiritual vision set by these first European settlers influenced the American
  way of life for centuries, but that influence has waned.</p>
  <p>I don&#39;t know if you noticed,
  but I have been conspicuously silent about the removal of the Ten Commandments
  monument outside that courthouse in Alabama. You also do not hear me
  bemoaning the absence of prayer in public schools. Is it that I am against
  the Ten Commandments or opposed to prayer? Certainly not! If you think
  that&#39;s the case, well, you do not know me very well! Is it that I think
  posting the Commandments or offering prayer is inappropriate in public
  institutions? No. I think posting the &#34;Big 10&#34; and leading children in the
  Lord&#39;s prayer is wonderful. I just do not think it is a good idea in our
  contemporary climate.</p>
  <p>Before you consider me a
  traitor to the faith, let me explain myself. I believe that our founding
  fathers believed that the government should do nothing to discourage the free
  exercise of religion. But by religion, they meant forms of Christianity (and
  possibly Judaism). If you read writings from our not-so-distant past, the
  term &#34;religion&#34; and &#34;Christianity&#34; were used interchangeably.</p>
  <p>But such is not the case in
  the collective mind of modern America. &#34;Religion&#34; refers to any and all
  creeds: Buddhism, Satanism, Islam, Native American religion, witchcraft, and
  Goddess worship. Not only are they all covered under the term, but they are
  viewed as having equal worth.</p>
  <p>Tolerance used to mean
  putting up with other viewpoints&#8212;especially those with whom you disagreed.&nbsp;
  But you were free to disagree and criticize opposing religious viewpoints.&nbsp;
  Now the word tolerance implies believing that all viewpoints are equally valid
  and equally true. They are immune from criticism. It is considered
  intolerant to say that one religion is true while asserting that another is
  false. Yet, in contradictory fashion, modern &#34;tolerance&#34; will not tolerate
  folks like us who condemn certain religions as erroneous. You can believe
  anything you want as long as you do not disbelieve something else.</p>
  <p>This strange shift in
  defining tolerance has been coupled with another viewpoint: everyone is
  entitled to equal time and exposure. Even though the majority of Americans
  profess some form of Christianity, the modern mentality says we should give
  all viewpoints an equal shot at things. As a matter of fact, we should give
  preference to minority beliefs to even out the playing field. If we allow a
  person to lead in a prayer to God through Christ, then we must also allow
  someone else to lead in a prayer to Satan or Allah. Let me ask you, do you
  really want this going on in our public school classrooms? If we make prayer
  legal in our classrooms, be assured, this WILL go on.</p>
  <p>Already we are seeing Moslem
  clerics opening Senate sessions with prayer. Michigan has hired a member of
  Wicca, the witchcraft organization, as a jail chaplain. In those public
  arenas where religious practice is still allowed, albeit this is inconsistent,
  we will continue to see influxes of competing religions. The post office has
  already issued stamps to commemorate Islamic holidays, for example.</p>
  <p>If America would choose to
  define itself as a Judeo-Christian country once again but practice
  old-fashioned tolerance toward other faiths, we could limit religious ministry
  within government institutions to Jews or Christians. But it is very unlikely
  that we will amend our constitution to make such a claim. Too many of us
  would view that as intolerant.</p>
  <p>So if we indeed allow the
  posting of the Ten Commandments in our current climate, portions of the Koran
  will soon follow elsewhere. There was a time when the government was friendly
  toward the Judeo-Christian viewpoint. But we have begun and will continue to
  lose our &#34;favored religion&#34; status. And, based on current reasoning, the
  government would go out of its way to promote the minority religions to
  compensate for centuries of promoting Christian viewpoints. Our faith is
  considered no better or worse than witchcraft.</p>
  <p>So which is worse, a school
  system or judicial system that promotes no particular religious viewpoint,
  other than belief in God, or one that promotes a hodgepodge of Christian,
  occult, Native American, Islamic, and Eastern religions?</p>
  <p>But there is more than one
  reason why I am not a champion of school prayer or fighting to post of the Ten
  Commandments on public property (although where these things pre-exist and are
  not controversial, I say, &#34;Shhh&#34;). What bothers me is the premise that school
  prayer will somehow transform our nation, or that our country began
  degenerating because of a lack of school prayer. I think school prayer
  probably did have a slightly positive effect, but not a great deal.</p>
  <p>The fact that school prayer
  was struck down as unconstitutional in 1963 did not start a spiritual decline,
  it was the consequence of that decline. If Americans strongly felt school
  prayer was important, they could have added an amendment to the constitution.&nbsp;
  Families stopped praying at home long before children stopped praying at
  school. The outlawing of school prayer was not the beginning of the disease,
  but a tell-tale symptom of a disease that was already well entrenched.</p>
  <p>What bothers me is that all
  these are token matters. What children really need are parents who will stay
  married, live out their faith at home, and teach their children to pray, study
  the Bible, participate with others, and follow the Ten Commandments. I have
  long said that no one should fight for posting the Ten Commandments who cannot
  recite them. If they really valued those Ten divinely-given rules, they most
  certainly should be able to list them!</p>
  <p>So what would be the ideal
  solution? If American Christians began taking their faith seriously, and if
  God used them to reach and disciple others, then perhaps we could re-establish
  America as a Judeo-Christian nation. At that point, it might be worth
  fighting over posting the Ten Commandments. But right now, I think no
  religion is better than false religion. And it is tragic that we have come to
  that.</p>
  <p>Many European nations allow
  and incorporate the teaching of religion in their public school systems. Yet,
  in many nations like France, Germany, and Italy, less than 5% of the
  population attend church. In many nations like Italy, there are more Jehovah
  Witnesses than there are born-again evangelical Christians. Getting religion
  into schools will not reach very many people. Perhaps a few, but not many.</p>
  <p>We have lost something
  precious in America, but we need to remember that Christianity is NOT about
  America. It is about Jesus. It is about glorifying God. It is about
  &#34;reaching, connecting, and deepening.&#34; We had nearly two centuries in which
  the government was on our side. We should be grateful for Uncle Sam&#39;s
  support, but we must get back to our foundations. Uncle Sam is turning a deaf
  ear to us these days. It is the Christian family&#39;s job to instill spiritual
  and moral values in their children. It is the Christian&#39;s responsibility to
  share Christ, and, in conjunction with the church body, to make disciples.&nbsp;
  And that hasn&#39;t changed. It was true when kids prayed in school and it is
  more true today. That responsibility transcends all cultures and all eras.&nbsp;
  We do not need government to help us do our job. Our prayer is merely that
  the government will not get in our way, and that we can do our job and still
  live peaceful lives. And if we do our job well and bolster the percentage of
  solid Christians in our nation, the government will become friendlier toward
  us, because our government is made up of the people. It all comes down the
  grassroots.</div>
