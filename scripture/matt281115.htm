<p><sup>11</sup> While the women were on their way, some of the 
guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had 
happened. <sup>12</sup> When the chief priests had met with the 
elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
<sup>13</sup> telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples 
came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’
<sup>14</sup> If this report gets to the governor, we will 
satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” <sup>15</sup> So the 
soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been 
widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. </p>
