<p><sup>1</sup> A few days later, when Jesus again entered 
Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. <sup>2</sup> So 
many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he 
preached the word to them. <sup>3</sup> Some men came, bringing 
to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. <sup>4</sup> Since 
they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in 
the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the 
paralyzed man was lying on. <sup>5</sup> When Jesus saw their 
faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”   
<p><sup>6</sup> Now some teachers of the law were sitting 
there, thinking to themselves, <sup>7</sup> “Why does this 
fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that 
this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are 
you thinking these things? <sup>9</sup> Which is easier: to say 
to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat 
and walk’? <sup>10</sup> But that you may know that the Son of 
Man has authority on earth to forgive sins....” He said to the paralytic,
<sup>11</sup> “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”
<sup>12</sup> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full 
view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have 
never seen anything like this!”</p>
