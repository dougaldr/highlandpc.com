<p><sup>11</sup> Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.
Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. <sup>12</sup>
And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were
opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged
according to what they had done as recorded in the books. <sup>13</sup> The sea
gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were
in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. <sup>14</sup>
Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the
second death. <sup>15</sup> If anyone's name was not found written in the book
of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.</p>
