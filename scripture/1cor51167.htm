<p><sup>5:11</sup> But now I am writing you that you must not associate with
anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an
idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler.&nbsp; With such a man do not even
eat.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church?&nbsp;
Are you not to judge those inside?&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> God will judge those outside.&nbsp;
&quot;Expel
the wicked man from among you.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>6:1</sup> If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it
before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?&nbsp; <sup>2</sup> Do
you not know that the saints will judge the world?&nbsp; And if you are to judge the
world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> Do you not
know that we will judge angels?&nbsp; How much more the things of this life!&nbsp;
<sup>4</sup>
Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men
of little account in the church!&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> I say this to shame you.&nbsp;
Is it
possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between
believers?&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> But instead, one brother goes to law against
another&#151;and this in front of unbelievers!</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have
been completely defeated already.&nbsp; Why not rather be wronged?&nbsp; Why not rather be
cheated?</p>
