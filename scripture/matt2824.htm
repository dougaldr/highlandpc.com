<p><sup>2</sup> There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of 
the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and 
sat on it. <sup>3</sup> His appearance was like lightning, and 
his clothes were white as snow. <sup>4</sup> The guards were so 
afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. </p>
