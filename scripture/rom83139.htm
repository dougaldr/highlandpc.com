<p><sup>31</sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this?&nbsp; If God is for us,
who can be against us?&nbsp; <sup>32</sup> He who did not spare his own Son, gut gave
him up for us all&#151;how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all
things?&nbsp; <sup>33</sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has
chosen?&nbsp; It is God who justifies.&nbsp; <sup>34</sup> Who is he that condemns?&nbsp;
Christ
Jesus, who died&#151;more than that, who was raised to life&#151;is at the right hand of
God and is also interceding for us.&nbsp; <sup>35</sup> Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ?&nbsp; Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness
or danger or sword?&nbsp; <sup>36</sup> As it is written:</p>

<p>&quot;For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to
be slaughtered.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>37</sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
who loved us.&nbsp; <sup>38</sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future nor any powers, <sup>39</sup>
neither height nor depth, for anything else in all creation will be able to
separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus or Lord.</p>
