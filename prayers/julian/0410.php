<br>April 10

<p>Dear God,</p>
<p>You are an active God. You are not passive. You are 
energetic, lively, vigorous and dynamic. You do not sit idly by wondering 
what will happen, nor are You some impersonal force that does neither process 
nor directs what happens. You participate with Your creation and You 
providentially steer the course of history. You are also active in my life 
working with me individually. You are active in the lives of all who have a 
saving relationship with Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Lord, even though You are the sovereign God, You hold us 
accountable and responsible for our behavior. You made us moral beings. Even 
though we are predisposed to sin and be selfish, we still choose to be this way 
in every instance. Indeed, You are the objective standard by which all right 
and wrong is measured and that standard is revealed in Your Word. Help us not 
to blame others for the wrongs we do, but to take responsibility for our own 
wrongs.</p>
<p>Your Word tells me that if I confess my sins, You are 
faithful and&nbsp;just to forgive me of them and You will cleanse me from 
all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 John 1:9</b>). So I bring my sins before You now. 
I do not excuse them, but I freely admit them and ask for Your&nbsp;forgiveness.</p>
<p>Lord, reconciliation within families is a painful issue. 
Please bring together members of my family—or of a family I know—who are at 
odds with other family members. We ask that the offenders would embrace 
repentance, apology, restitution, the embracing of responsibility and 
reasonability, or the reestablishment of credibility, whatever is needed to 
mend the fences. And we pray that those offended would be gracious yet not 
naïve. We know some situations can never be fixed, but we pray that repairable 
relationships would experience reconciliation</p>
<p>Lord, today I pray for the over 729 million people who 
populate the continent of Europe. It breaks my heart that only 2.4% of the 
population claims to be born-again evangelicals.</p>
<p>Lord, in centuries gone by Europe was the leading evangelical 
continent. We know that in northern Europe there are still some evangelical 
churches here and there, but in southern and southeastern Europe they are few 
and far between. Younger generations view the Christian faith as the domain of 
the elderly and believe it has no bearing on them. Christianity has been 
through the continent and has virtually left.</p>
<p>Father, revive Your work in Europe. May the number of 
Evangelical Christians double within the next decade, and may Your Spirit hover 
and rekindle what is left of its spiritual embers.</p>
<p>Lord, today I pray for my denomination, fellowship, or a 
denomination or fellowship I respect. I pray that You would keep the leaders 
close to You, guide them by Your Holy Spirit, help them to take seriously the 
responsibility to conform to the truth of Scripture, and use them for Your 
glory. May they experience harmony, but not at the pricetag of sacrificing the 
basic and clear truths of Scripture.</p>
<p>Father, bless those who work as pilots. May they safely 
deliver their passengers; may many of them come to know You and help those who 
are Christians to walk with You and to share the good news.</p>
<p>Now help me be Christ-like today, I pray in Jesus’ Name, 
Amen.</p>
