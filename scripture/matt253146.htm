<p><sup>31 </sup>&quot;When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the
angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. <sup>32 </sup>All
the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one
from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. <sup>33 </sup>He
will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left."</p>

<p><sup>34 </sup>&quot;Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you
who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for
you since the creation of the world. <sup>35 </sup>For I was hungry and you gave
me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a
stranger and you invited me in, <sup>36 </sup>I needed clothes and you clothed
me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit
me.'"</p>

<p><sup>37 </sup>&quot;Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we
see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? <sup>38
</sup>When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and
clothe you? <sup>39 </sup>When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit
you?'"</p>

<p><sup>40 </sup>&quot;The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you
did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'"</p>

<p><sup>41 </sup>&quot;Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me,
you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
<sup>42 </sup>For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and
you gave me nothing to drink, <sup>43 </sup>I was a stranger and you did not
invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in
prison and you did not look after me.'"</p>

<p><sup>44 </sup>&quot;They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry
or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not
help you?'"</p>

<p><sup>45 </sup>&quot;He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did
not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'"</p>

<p><sup>46 </sup>&quot;Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the
righteous to eternal life."</p>
