<p><sup>12</sup> How you have fallen from heaven,<br>
O morning star, son of the dawn!<br>
You have been cast down to the earth,<br>
you who once laid low the nations!<br>
<sup>13</sup> You said in your heart,<br>
&quot;I will ascend to heaven;<br>
I will raise my throne<br>
above the stars of God;<br>
I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly,<br>
on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.<br>
<sup>14</sup> I will ascend above the tops of the clouds;<br>
I will make myself like the Most High.&quot;<br>
<sup>15</sup> But you are brought down to the grave,<br>
to the depths of the pit.<br>
<br>
<sup>16</sup> Those who see you stare at you,<br>
they ponder your fate:<br>
&quot;Is this the man who shook the earth<br>
and made kingdoms tremble,<br>
<sup>17</sup> the man who made the world a desert,<br>
who overthrew its cities<br>
and would not let his captives go home?&quot;</p>
