<p>God of the Years,</p>
<p>Although we age and pass away from this life like the grass, You go on 
unscathed by time. Yet You are the Ancient of Days. Your eternal nature 
compliments Your infinite wisdom. We tend to think of gray or white hair as a 
sign of both age and the accumulated wisdom of age. But You have always had all 
wisdom and knowledge. When Daniel saw a vision of You, He wrote, &quot;As I looked, 
thrones were set in place, and the Ancient of Days took his seat. His clothing 
was as white as snow; the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was 
flaming with fire and its wheels were all ablaze&quot; (<b>Daniel 7:9</b>). I praise 
You as the &quot;all wise One.&quot; Thank You for sharing some of Your wisdom in Your 
Word.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You today. They are: __________.</p>
<p>First John says that if I confess my sins, You are faithful and&nbsp;just to 
forgive me those sins, and You will purify me from all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 
John 1:9</b>). I confess the sins I am aware of now and I ask Your Spirit to 
search my heart. (<i>Pause to admit them to God.</i>)</p>
<p>Help me to do my part by volunteering to serve or continuing to serve in a 
Bible-believing, Bible-teaching church. May I set my roots down deeply and to 
attend every week I am able to do so.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to be a kind, compassionate person. Help me to check arrogance 
and get a true estimate of myself, Your estimate. Help me to reach out to 
newcomers at church, to open my home, to learn to relax and be at ease with 
others and to make them feel comfortable with me.</p>
<p>Today I pray for Hong Kong, formerly a British colony but now under the 
protection of the People's Republic of China. Its 7.5 million people are among 
Asia’s wealthiest. Thank You that the Chinese government is still respecting 
the right to religious freedom in Hong Kong. O Father, may that freedom 
continue. Thank You that over 5% of the population claim to be born-again 
evangelicals. Since many Chinese Christians migrated to other nations before 
the 1997 turnover of Hong Kong to China, the church needs mature leaders. O 
God, stir up the Christians in Hong. May the number of believers double over the 
next decade, I ask. Help the church to become mature and strong in You.</p>
<p>Thank You for the ministry of Feba, &quot;Feba has program production and 
coordination centers in India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Cyprus, Kenya, Mozambique, 
Zimbabwe, South Africa and the UK. We arrange international broadcasting using a 
number of different stations, while in Africa Feba owns an FM station and 
partners the operation of another. [They] work to reach the unreached with the 
Gospel, penetrating areas torn apart by war or ravaged by natural disaster...to 
bring the Good News of Jesus to people in a language they understand.&quot; O God, 
provide for, guide, empower and bless this ministry, I pray.</p>
<p>Help me to be a patient person today, I ask in Messiah’s Name, Amen.</p>
