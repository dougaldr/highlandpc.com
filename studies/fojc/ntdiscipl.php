<p>The best synonym for 
“disciple” is “learner.” A disciple of Jesus Christ is learning from Him and 
about Him. In that sense, our “Focus on Jesus” series is especially relevant. 
Unfortunately, many Christians have forsaken this serious learning about Jesus 
Christ for what is popularly called a “felt needs” approach to Christianity. 
Whereas it may be appropriate to address “felt needs” (and I think it is), we 
should not do so at the expense of growing in the grace and knowledge of our 
Lord Jesus Christ. Anyhow, here are several shades of usage for the term 
“disciple.” </p>
<ol><li><b>A genuine believer in 
Jesus Christ.</b> The word “disciple” is never used past the Book of 
Acts. The letters (epistles) and Revelation used terms like, “saint, brother, 
believer, Christian” when referring to followers of Jesus Christ. Yet when we 
look at how Paul, Peter, and others ministered, they were, in essence, making 
disciples. People were won to faith, they were baptized, and they began to 
intensely study and apply the Scriptures, conforming their lives accordingly. 
In the most basic sense, a genuine believer in Jesus Christ is a disciple.</p>
<li><b>Christian Leadership 
Development.</b> Someone who studied and traveled with Jesus Christ during 
His earthly ministry could become a disciple in a way that none of us can 
today. David Stern, in <u>The Jewish New Testament Commentary</u> enlightens us 
about the <i>Talmidim</i> (the Hebrew word for disciple, which is what one would 
have heard Jesus disciples called):</p>
<blockquote>“The English word “disciple” 
fails to convey the richness of relationship between a rabbi and his <i>talmidim</i> 
in the first century.... Teachers, both itinerant like Yeshua (Jesus) and settled 
ones, attracted followers who wholeheartedly gave themselves over to their 
teacher (though not in a mindless way, as happens today in some cults). The 
essence of the relationship was one of trust in every area of living, and its 
goal was to make the talmid [disciple] like his rabbi in knowledge, wisdom and 
ethical behavior…” (p. 23).</blockquote></ol>
<p>This unique ministry of discipleship cannot be repeated today. We can draw 
applications, however, and experience less perfect discipleship models. For 
example, Paul said, “Follow my example as I follow the example of Christ” (<b>1 Corinthians 11:1</b>). Perhaps the best 
model for discipleship in the church age (now that Jesus is not physically 
present and walking the earth) is that of <b>2 Timothy 2:2</b>: “And the things you have heard 
me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also 
be qualified to teach others.”</p>
