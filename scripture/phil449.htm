<p><sup>4</sup> Rejoice in the Lord always. I 
will say it again: Rejoice! <sup>5</sup> Let your 
gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
<sup>6</sup> Do not be anxious about anything, 
but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your 
requests to God. <sup>7</sup> And the peace of 
God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds 
in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, 
whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is 
excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. <sup>9</sup> Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me&#151;put it
into practice.&nbsp; And the God of peace will be with you.</p>
