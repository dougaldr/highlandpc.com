<p><sup>1</sup> “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be 
like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
<sup>2</sup> Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
<sup>3</sup> The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take 
any oil with them. <sup>4</sup> The wise, however, took oil in 
jars along with their lamps. <sup>5</sup> The bridegroom was a 
long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.” </p>
<p><sup>6</sup> “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here's the 
bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’” </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed 
their lamps. <sup>8</sup> The foolish ones said to the wise, 
‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’” </p>
<p><sup>9</sup> “ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be 
enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for 
yourselves.’” </p>
<p><sup>10</sup> “But while they were on their way to buy 
the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to 
the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.” </p>
<p><sup>11</sup> “Later the others also came. ‘Sir! Sir!’ 
they said. ‘Open the door for us!’” </p>
<p><sup>12</sup> “But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I 
don't know you.’” </p>
<p><sup>13</sup> “Therefore keep watch, because you do not 
know the day or the hour.” </p>
<p><sup>14</sup> “Again, it will be like a man going on a 
journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
<sup>15</sup> To one he gave five talents 
of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to 
his ability. Then he went on his journey. <sup>16</sup> The man 
who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and 
gained five more. <sup>17</sup> So also, the one with the two 
talents gained two more. <sup>18</sup> But the man who had 
received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's 
money.” </p>   
<p><sup>19</sup> “After a long time the master of those 
servants returned and settled accounts with them. <sup>20</sup> The 
man who had received the five talents brought the other five. ‘Master,’ he said, 
‘you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’” </p>
<p><sup>21</sup> “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and 
faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in 
charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!’” </p>
<p><sup>22</sup> “The man with the two talents also came. 
‘Master,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two 
more.’” </p>
<p><sup>23</sup> “His master replied, ‘Well done, good and 
faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in 
charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!’” </p>
<p><sup>24</sup> “Then the man who had received the one 
talent came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting 
where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
<sup>25</sup> So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent 
in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’” </p>
<p><sup>26</sup> “His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy 
servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I 
have not scattered seed? <sup>27</sup> Well then, you should 
have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would 
have received it back with interest.” </p>
<p><sup>28</sup> “‘Take the talent from him and give it to 
the one who has the ten talents. <sup>29</sup> For everyone who 
has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, 
even what he has will be taken from him. <sup>30</sup> And 
throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be 
weeping and gnashing of teeth.’” </p>
