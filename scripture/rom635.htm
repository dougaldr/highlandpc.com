<p> <sup>3</sup>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ
Jesus were baptized into his death? <sup>4</sup>We were therefore buried with
him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the
dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</p>

<p> <sup>5</sup>If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will
certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. <sup>6</sup>For we know
that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done
away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin— <sup>7</sup>because
anyone who has died has been freed from sin.<br>
