<p><sup>9</sup> The great dragon was hurled down&#151;that ancient serpent called
the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray.&nbsp; He was hurled to the
earth, and his angels with him.</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:</p>

<p>&quot;Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God,
and the authority of his Christ.&nbsp; For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses
them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup> They
overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they
did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.&quot;</p>
