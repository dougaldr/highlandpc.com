<p><sup>3</sup> Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head
of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. <sup>4</sup> Every man who prays or 
prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <sup>5</sup> And every woman who prays 
or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is just as though her head were 
shaved. <sup>6</sup> If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; 
and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her 
head. <sup>7</sup> A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; 
but the woman is the glory of man. <sup>8</sup> For man did not come from woman, but woman 
from man; <sup>9</sup> neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. <sup>10</sup> 
For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on 
her head.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man 
independent of woman.</p>
