<br>A Prayer for Our President
<br><span class=redbld>occasioned by Hurricane Katrina of 2005</span>

</p>

<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>As we think of our president, our gracious God, we first 
thank You for our nation and the many blessings you have given us. From the 
beginning, many of our leaders and citizens have trusted in Your Providence and 
care and You have been our steadfast pillar, a true Rock of Help.</p>
<p>Lord, these past few years have been rough for us. We know 
things could get worse, much worse; we ask You to prevent that. Instead, we 
pray that we would continue to receive Your lavish grace. We ask this not 
because we claim to deserve it, but because You are gracious.</p>
<p>Dear God, our president has been in the &quot;hot seat&quot; for 
almost his entire tenure as president. Perhaps no president in modern times has 
had to face the challenges that George W. Bush has had to face. Few have been 
tested as he has been: the disaster of September 11<sup>th</sup>, the War on 
Terror in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Tsunami, and now, Lord, our own Tsunami of 
sorts -- the horrors of Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Almighty One, as the God Who Really Sees, we pray that You 
would see the stresses and decisions our president must make. As the 
All-Knowing One, we pray that You would impart Your wisdom to him. As the 
All-Powerful One, we pray that You would strengthen him and his staff for the 
long hours and intense requirements of his responsibilities. We pray that Your 
children would under gird him in prayer and respect his office, whether agreeing 
or disagreeing with his decisions.</p>
<p>Lord, we know we are a nation of armchair generals who love 
to second-guess the president's every move. For better or worse, we admit that 
this is the American way. We believe it is better than the way of regimes that 
oppress free speech, but, Lord, we do sometimes remind ourselves of the Children 
of Israel murmuring in the wilderness! </p>
<p>We know that, as a human being, every president is sure to 
make mistakes. No matter what he does or decides, he will experience a barrage 
of attacks upon him. That might be tolerable when it is &quot;business as usual,&quot; but 
these days are anything but that. We pray that this barrage would give way to a 
team spirit, and that his critics would not distract him from the course you 
want him to follow. We pray that You would lead him in that course. We pray that 
he would be able to ignore the constant whining and make decisions based on 
sound judgment, in no way intimidated by the multitude of critics.</p>
<p>Dear God, we know our president is a man of faith, a man 
who knows You, a man who trusts You. But he is only human and has been in the 
pressure cooker so long. Help him as only You can. Lord, in Your Sovereignty, 
You have placed him in office for such times as these. Be his strength and 
shield, we pray, in Jesus' Name.</p>
