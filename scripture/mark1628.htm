<p><sup>2</sup> Very early on the first day of the week, just 
after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb <sup>3</sup> and 
they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the 
tomb?” </p>
<p><sup>4</sup> But when they looked up, they saw that the 
stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. <sup>5</sup> As 
they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on 
the right side, and they were alarmed. </p>
<p><sup>6</sup> “Don't be alarmed,” he said. “You are 
looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. 
See the place where they laid him. <sup>7</sup> But go, tell 
his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will 
see him, just as he told you.’ ” </p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Trembling and bewildered, the women went out 
and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
