<p><sup>1</sup> After this I saw four angels standing at the four 
corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any 
wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
<sup>2</sup> Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, 
having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four 
angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea:
<sup>3</sup> &quot;Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees 
until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.&quot;
<sup>4</sup> Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 
144,000 from all the tribes of Israel. <br>
<sup>5</sup> From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed,
<br>
from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Gad 12,000, <br>
<sup>6</sup> from the tribe of Asher 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000, <br>
<sup>7</sup> from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Levi 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Issachar 12,000, <br>
<sup>8</sup> from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, <br>
from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000. 
<p><sup>9</sup> After this I looked and there before me was a 
great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and 
language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing 
white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.</p>
