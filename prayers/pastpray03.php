<br>Prayer #3
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Our gracious God,</p>
<p>How we praise You that You are our Mighty Redeemer. We 
recognize that You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, all had part in buying your 
children back from the slave market of sin, doomed to experience Your righteous 
wrath. Instead, you have made us objects of mercy, recipients of grace, 
destined to become companions and siblings with our Savior, the Lord Jesus 
Christ.</p>
<p>Lord, we are not worthy to be brought into Your family for 
countless reasons. But that did not stop You. We pray that You would help us 
prepare for heavenly fellowship by learning to love our families, friends, and 
fellow believers in the here and now. Help us develop social skills, to 
practice kindness, and to put ourselves in the shoes of others instead of 
offering smug and simplistic answers.</p>
<p>We remember pastors, evangelists, missionaries, and 
countless workers in God’s Kingdom, particularly those who know You and are true 
to Your Word. Bless their walk with You, their families, their health, and 
their ministries. Nurture them, use them, and find great pleasure in them, we 
ask.</p>
<p>We also remember our Supreme Court Justices. We pray that 
they would fear You and that they would render fair and proper verdicts 
consistent with Your justice.</p>
<p>Father, the needs we have hit close to home. Some of us 
are struggling with relationships, others with finances, others with difficult 
decisions, while others have health issues that never seem to let up. And 
Almighty One, there are so many problems and categories of problem or heartache 
that we dare not list them all. But for these things, Lord, we have You. You 
are our ultimate Resource, and we pray that You would have Your perfect will in 
each situation.</p>
<p>Now as we sing Your praises and enjoy the sweet honey of 
Your Word, we pray Your continued blessing upon us.</p>
<p>We pray in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
