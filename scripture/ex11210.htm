<p><sup>1:1</sup> These are the names of the sons of 
Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:
<sup>2</sup> Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
<sup>3</sup> Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
<sup>4</sup> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
<sup>5</sup> The descendants of Jacob numbered 
seventy  
in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Now Joseph and all his brothers 
and all that generation died, <sup>7</sup> but 
the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly 
numerous, so that the land was filled with them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Then a new king, who did not 
know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. <sup>9</sup> 
&quot;Look,&quot; he said to his people, &quot;the Israelites have become much too numerous for 
us. <sup>10</sup> Come, we must deal shrewdly 
with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will 
join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> So they put slave masters over 
them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as 
store cities for Pharaoh. <sup>12</sup> But the 
more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians 
came to dread the Israelites <sup>13</sup> and 
worked them ruthlessly. <sup>14</sup> They made 
their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of 
work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> The king of Egypt said to the 
Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
<sup>16</sup> &quot;When you help the Hebrew women in 
childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but 
if it is a girl, let her live.&quot; <sup>17</sup> The 
midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told 
them to do; they let the boys live. <sup>18</sup> 
Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, &quot;Why have you done 
this? Why have you let the boys live?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>19</sup> The midwives answered Pharaoh, 
&quot;Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth 
before the midwives arrive.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> So God was kind to the midwives 
and the people increased and became even more numerous.
<sup>21</sup> And because the midwives feared 
God, he gave them families of their own. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Then Pharaoh gave this order to 
all his people: &quot;Every boy that is born  
you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>2:1</sup> Now a man of the house of Levi 
married a Levite woman, <sup>2</sup> and she 
became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, 
she hid him for three months. <sup>3</sup> But 
when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated 
it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the 
reeds along the bank of the Nile. <sup>4</sup> 
His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Then Pharaoh's daughter went 
down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. 
She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.
<sup>6</sup> She opened it and saw the baby. He 
was crying, and she felt sorry for him. &quot;This is one of the Hebrew babies,&quot; she 
said. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> Then his sister asked Pharaoh's 
daughter, &quot;Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for 
you?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> &quot;Yes, go,&quot; she answered. And the 
girl went and got the baby's mother. <sup>9</sup> 
Pharaoh's daughter said to her, &quot;Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will 
pay you.&quot; So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
<sup>10</sup> When the child grew older, she took 
him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses,  
saying, &quot;I drew him out of the water.&quot;</p>
