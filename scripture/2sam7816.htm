<p><sup>8</sup> Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, “Thus 
says the Lord of hosts, ‘I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, 
that you should be prince over my people Israel. <sup>9</sup> And I have been 
with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. 
And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the 
earth. <sup>10</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will 
plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. 
And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly, <sup>11</sup> from the 
time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will give you rest from 
all your enemies. Moreover, the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a 
house. <sup>12</sup> When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your 
fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, 
and I will establish his kingdom. <sup>13</sup> He shall build a house for my name, 
and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. <sup>14</sup> I will be to 
him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline 
him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, <sup>15</sup> but my 
steadfast love will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from 
before you. <sup>16</sup> And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever 
before me. Your throne shall be established forever.’”</p>
