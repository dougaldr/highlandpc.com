<br>A Christian Wedding Prayer 3 (for dedicated Christians)
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Our Great God,</p>
<p>We thank You for Your grace. It is Your grace that saves 
us, it is Your grace that provides strength for daily living, and it is Your 
grace that blesses with great joys. We rejoice in Your ordination of marriage. 
Thank You for leading __________ and __________ together by Your grace.</p>
<p>Lord, we are all sinners, and when two become one, their 
unity will always be imperfect because we are imperfect. Yet, in Christ, we are 
a new creation, and Your Spirit is transforming us into the character of 
Christ. Help this couple to be considerate of one another, to be forgiving, to 
practice patience day after day and year after year, and to confront one another 
when necessary. Keep them far away from sarcasm and contempt. May they express 
themselves honestly and openly. Help them to work as a team, each looking out 
for the good of the other.</p>
<p>God, unless You build the house, they labor in vain who 
build it. We pray, our gracious Father, that You would build this house. 
Accomplish Your will in this marriage, and glorify Your Name. Help __________ 
and __________ to love one another as friends, as brother and sister in Christ, 
and as man and wife. May they not forget they are friends. Nurture their 
friendship, we ask. May they not forget they are followers of Jesus Christ; help 
them to remember the call to build up one another spiritually, as brothers and 
sisters in Christ are meant to do. Marriage does not replace friendship nor our 
place in the Body of Christ. </p>
<p>As man and wife, help this bride and groom to relate to each other as 
Christ, the groom, does to His bride, the Church. The Savior leads but does not 
coerce. The church follows the direction of her Savior. Jesus gave His life for 
the church, offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins to the Father. In 
Gethsemane, Jesus did not feel like dying for the church, but He did what was in 
the church's best interest, even when that best interest ran contrary to His 
feelings. Help this bride and groom to remember that love means sacrifice. Love 
is all the more potent when we choose to love contrary to our feelings.</p>
<p>Just as Christ rose to newness of life on that first Easter 
Sunday, so You, O Father, bless and exalt those who serve You and follow Your 
plan. </p>
<p>And so, Lord, __________ and __________ enter the marriage 
covenant with faith in You. We pray that You would bless and guide them 
throughout their lives, grant them peace and harmony, and we pray that You would 
help them observe the vows they make today. We ask all these things in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
