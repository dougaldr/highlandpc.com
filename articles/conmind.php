<br>Conviction and the Mind

<p>Some people like to think. I do only when it matters, 
which is why I never play chess. Some people hate thinking and reduce life to 
simple solutions and habits. Others reject simplistic and naïve answers. 
Perhaps most of us are somewhere in between.</p>
<p>When you personally commit yourself to Jesus Christ and 
place your loyalty in His camp, a set of convictions are inseparably joined to 
that commitment. For example, you now embrace the belief that Christ is God, 
that He died to pay for your sins and rose again. If you do not embrace those 
convictions, you are not truly in Christ. They are inseparable. You now 
understand the Scriptures the way Jesus understood them, true down to the 
smallest strokes of the Hebrew letters, the jot and tittle 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/matt518.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Matthew 5:18</a>).</p>
<p>People who thought in deep ways before their conversion 
continue to think in deep and broad ways afterwards. People who thought in 
shallow fashion tend to do the same. In both instances, their convictions serve 
as boundaries of truth, and they often think more reasonably and realistically 
because of those convictions. For example, because we embrace the conviction 
that human beings are sinners by nature, we know we cannot create an Utopian 
society and so we do not even try. Secular intellectuals often have to learn 
this the hard way. We know homosexual practice is wrong because God says so. 
We do not have to study laboratory mice to figure this out.</p>
<p>But unexamined convictions and discomfort with thinking 
broadly and deeply lessen the credibility of our faith and result in a 
conglomeration of convictions, some of which may have no relationship to the 
Word of God and may even run contrary to it.</p>
<p>When Josh McDowell was in town in mid February, he 
emphasized how most evangelical Christians today do not know what they believe 
and even more they do not know WHY they believe it. He asked the question, 
&quot;What evidence do you have that the Bible is true?&quot; He ruled out personal 
testimony (logically so) because Mormons, Buddhists, and Muslims can counter 
with their testimonies.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, &quot;Vasicek, at least many of our folks 
at HPC could answer that question.&quot; As a matter of fact, just the week before 
Josh visited Kokomo, I addressed that issue as part of a sermon introduction. I 
used the existence of the nation of Israel, despite genocide attempts and being 
without a homeland for 1900 years, as a simple evidence that the Bible is true. 
Of course no evidence <i>proves</i> the Bible is true; the evidence merely shows 
that it is <i>reasonable</i> to believe such is the case.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all too many Christians would defend their 
belief by saying, &quot;Well, that’s what my parents taught me.&quot; I’d like to respond 
to such people in this way: &quot;Who in the world are your parents? Did they work 
miracles? Were they raised bodily from the dead? Why should I listen to your 
parents anymore than my own?&quot;</p>
<p>Josh then went on to demonstrate how Christians have 
abandoned absolute truth. For example, in most Bible studies, people ask, &quot;What 
does this verse mean to you?&quot; Now that is <i>not</i> a bad question <i>if </i>
it means, &quot;What do you think the author meant?&quot; In that instance, we are 
acknowledging that it is the author’s intended meaning that matters. We might 
disagree as to what he meant, but we know it is only one thing. But if we mean 
to imply that the verse has an infinite number of <i>legitimate </i>
interpretations, we may as well toss the book out. No one can be accountable to 
a standard that shapes itself to anyone’s whims. The Bible is an inspired book, 
not a magic book that moulds itself around our lives. It is true that we may 
find many ways to <i>apply</i> a truth of Scripture, but each verse has only one 
main meaning, even if it is also a prophetic shadow. It is the author’s 
intended meaning that counts.</p>
<p>Josh went on to emphasize one of my favorite themes: the 
importance of believers using and cultivating their minds. If you have ever 
read the Book of Proverbs, you realize that God places great emphasis upon 
wisdom. Proverbs inspires us to think things through <i>first</i> and <i>then</i> 
decide (look before you leap), to make commitments cautiously but to keep the 
ones we do make, to be receptive to correction, and to be anxious to grow in 
knowledge. Although wisdom is not emotionless, it is predominantly a mind 
thing.</p>
<p>So let me assume that you agree with me, that a mindless 
Christianity is not the best strain. How do we balance keeping our minds open 
when we embrace some pretty clear-cut convictions that limit our options?</p>
<p><b>First, be sure you have accurate convictions.</b> What 
is their basis? As someone who was not reared in an evangelical home, my 
convictions came partly from the Bible and partly from the instruction of my 
parents. When I came to Christ, I tried to test my convictions by the Word of 
God.</p>
<p>If you were fortunate enough to have parents who embraced 
the faith, you probably received many of your beliefs from them. That’s great—IF those convictions are Scripturally demonstrable. God has children, but no 
grandchildren. Each one of us must personally covenant with God. If we choose 
to place our loyalties with Christ and His Word, we need to examine whether our 
inherited beliefs are consistent with His Word so we can make them OUR OWN 
beliefs.</p>
<p><b>Second, try to understand where others are coming from.</b> 
There are intelligent people who hold to all sorts of viewpoints. Behind 
everyone’s way of thinking is a world view, a set of convictions. All 
convictions are NOT equally valid, but the behavior of most people is explicable 
when you understand their underlying beliefs. The 9/11 terrorist attack made 
perfect sense to me once I understood how the terrorists thought. Because I am 
convinced that the Bible is true, I can assert that their actions were wrong 
before God, too. The terrorists did not see it that way (they do now!). 
Remember Vasicek’s law: &quot;People always do what they do for a reason.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Third, we need to embrace logic.</b> Logic is the 
friend of truth. We need to learn how to reason. Beginning with a Biblical 
world view, we can now attempt to reason. We find our major premise (for 
example, &quot;all functional automobiles have wheels&quot;), then our minor premise, (&quot;my 
Dodge is a functional automobile&quot;) and we then draw a valid conclusion 
(&quot;therefore my Dodge has wheels&quot;).</p>
<p>More importantly, we must avoid drawing <i>wrong</i> 
conclusions. &quot;All functional automobiles have wheels. My Dodge has wheels. 
Therefore my Dodge is a functioning automobile.&quot; Hmm. What if my Dodge had no 
engine? Would it still be a functioning automobile? Using the reasoning above, 
we might conclude so.</p>
<p>Although textbooks on logic categorize fallacies in complex 
ways, the above error can be thwarted if we simply remember this principle: 
Truth is not necessarily WHOLE truth. It is true that functioning automobiles 
have wheels, but there is more truth besides that one: they also have engines, 
steering wheels, etc.</p>
<p><b>Fourth, let’s read.</b> Read your Bible, read good 
Christian books and even some good secular books. We also need to resurrect a 
concept that we are losing: the Bible needs to be studied. It is not enough to 
find a devotional nugget to enrich our day. We need to dig into the Word. 
Participate in Sunday School and attend services with a spirit eager to learn.</p>
<p>If the trend toward a more shallow evangelicalism 
continues, it is just a matter of time before our theological base 
disintegrates. When people divorce their faith from their minds, all sorts of 
strange filler materials creep in. If goofy doctrines replace Biblical truth, 
evangelicals will no longer be sharing the true Gospel. In our small way, let’s 
prevent this from happening by activating those gray cells. Only you can 
prevent truth decay!</p>
