<p><sup>9</sup> When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls 
of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they 
had maintained. <sup>10</sup> They called out in a loud voice, "How long, 
Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth 
and avenge our blood?" <sup>11</sup> Then each of them was given a white robe, 
and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow 
servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.</p>
