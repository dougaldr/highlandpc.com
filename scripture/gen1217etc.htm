<p><sup>Chapter 12</sup><br>
<sup>1</sup> Now the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Abram, “Go from your country
and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you.
<sup>2</sup> And I will make of you a great nation, and I 
will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing.
<sup>3</sup> I will bless those who bless you, and him 
who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall 
be blessed.”</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> So Abram went, as the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had 
told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he 
departed from Haran.
<sup>5</sup> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his 
brother's son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people 
that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. 
When they came to the land of Canaan,
<sup>6</sup> Abram passed through the land to the place 
at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
<sup>7</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>
appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he 
built there an altar to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>,
who had appeared to him.</p>

<p><sup>Chapter 13</sup><br>
<sup>14-17</sup> The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, 
“Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward 
and eastward and westward, <sup>15</sup>  for all the land that you see I will give 
to you and to your offspring forever. <sup>16</sup>  I will make your offspring as 
the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your 
offspring also can be counted. <sup>17</sup>  Arise, walk through the length and the 
breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.”</p>

<p><sup>Chapter 17</sup><br>
<sup>1-14</sup> When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to 
Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, 
<sup>2</sup> that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply 
you greatly.” <sup>3</sup> Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him, 
<sup>4</sup> “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of
a multitude of nations. <sup>5</sup> No longer shall your name be called Abram,
but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude 
of nations. <sup>6</sup> I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make 
you into nations, and kings shall come from you. <sup>7</sup> And I will 
establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout 
their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your 
offspring after you. <sup>8</sup> And I will give to you and to your offspring 
after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an 
everlasting possession, and I will be their God.”</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, 
you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. 
<sup>10</sup> This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and 
your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
<sup>11</sup> You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it 
shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. <sup>12</sup> He who is eight
days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, 
whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not 
of your offspring, <sup>13</sup> both he who is born in your house and he who is 
bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in 
your flesh an everlasting covenant. <sup>14</sup> Any uncircumcised male who is 
not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he 
has broken my covenant.”</p>

<p><sup>Chapter 22</sup><br>
<sup>15</sup> And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven 
<sup>16</sup> and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have 
done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, <sup>17</sup> I will surely 
bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as 
the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his 
enemies, <sup>18</sup> and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be 
blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”</p>
