<p>Gracious Lord,</p>
<p>Lord, You are not only the God of Abraham and Sarah, but 
also the God of Hagar. When she was cast out into the desert with her son, 
Ishmael, she was prepared to die of thirst. But You, O Lord, are the God Who 
sees. You saw her plight and directed her to water so that she and her son 
might live. Even though Hagar and Ishmael were not in the line of promise, You 
still love and care about individuals. You are truly the God Who sees. And I 
know that You see and care for me!</p>
<p>Help me to resist temptation and the lures of the Satan 
today. I know he and his forces are out to deceive me, to tempt me and to 
hinder my effectiveness for You, O Lord. Please bind Satan and help me to stand 
firm, dressed in the armor of God.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for family, friends and acquaintances who 
suffer from dementia. Our minds are so very precious and when they 
deteriorate, Lord, it is so very tragic indeed. You rarely heal those who have 
such an ailment, but You can do so if You will to do so. I pray that in these 
cases You would do so. Yet, like Jesus at Gethsemane, I say, “not my will, but 
Yours be done.”</p>
<p>Father, help me take time to unwind. In Your Law, folks 
not only rested on the Sabbath, but they did not work the first year of 
marriage. They took off every seventh year and there were several scattered 
holidays—plus the time it took to make the three annual pilgrimages to 
Jerusalem. They even camped out for a week during the feast of Tabernacles. Help 
me remember that You, the Lord, are my Shepherd, not my foreman.</p>
<p>Lord, the nation of Poland, with it 39 million people, has 
very few evangelicals, less than .2%. There are more Jehovah’s Witnesses in 
Poland than born-again Christians! New age teaching and paganism are gaining 
ground. Yet, Lord, the church is beginning to grow. Thank You for the radio 
broadcasts and strategic studies being done. O Father, may the evangelical 
church grow tenfold over the next decade and then tenfold again over the next 
decade, should Jesus not come before then. May Your Spirit move over this 
nation; draw the multitudes to Him, I ask.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord for the Jian Hua Foundation (JHF) which 
means &quot;build China.&quot; Their “vision is to serve the peoples of China by 
sending: language teachers, specialists in other fields, medical and social 
workers, relief and development workers and businessmen and women. While 
committed to the majority Han Chinese [they] also have a special interest in 
helping the poorer parts of the country and reaching some of China's national 
minority people groups.” Although they do not technically send out missionaries 
[something not allowed], Christians are encouraged to connect to a Chinese 
Church and be the salt of the earth. Father, bless this ministry and use those 
who serve to testify to Your grace and bear much fruit. Guide the leaders, 
empower them by Your Spirit, protect and provide for them, I ask.</p>
<p>I commit this day to You, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
