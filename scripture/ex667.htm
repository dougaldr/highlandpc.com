<p><sup>6</sup> Therefore, say to the 
Israelites: "I am the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the 
Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with 
an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
<sup>7</sup> I will take you as my own people, 
and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> your God, who 
brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians."</p>
