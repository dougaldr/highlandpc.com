<p><sup>1</sup> In the year that King Uzziah died, I aw the Lord seated on a
throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.&nbsp; <sup>2</sup>
Above him were seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered
their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.&nbsp;
<sup>3</sup>
And they were calling to one another:</p>

<p>&quot;Holy, holy, holy is the L<span>ORD</span> Almighty; the whole earth is
full of his glory.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook
and the temple was filled with smoke.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> &quot;Woe to me!&quot; I cried.&nbsp; &quot;I am ruined!&nbsp; For I am a
man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have
seen the King, the L<span>ORD</span> Almighty.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, 
which he had taken with tongs from the altar.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup> With it he
touched my mouth and said, &quot;See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is
taken away and your sin atoned for.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, &quot;Whom shall I
send?&nbsp; And who will go for us?&quot;</p>
<p>And I said, &quot;Here am I. Send me!&quot;</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> He said, &quot;Go and tell this people:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never
perceiving.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> Make the heart of this people calloused; make their
ears dull and close their eyes.&nbsp; Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear
with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> Then I said, &quot;For how long, O Lord?&quot;</p>
<p>And he answered:</p>
<p>&quot;Until the cities lie ruined and ravaged, <sup>12</sup> until the L<span>ORD</span>
has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> And
though a tenth remains&nbsp; in the land, it will again be laid waste.&nbsp; But as
the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will
be the stump in the land.&quot;</p>
