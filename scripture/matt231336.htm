<p><sup>13</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and 
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You 
yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
</p>
<p><sup>15</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and 
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, 
and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are. 
</p>
<p><sup>16</sup> “Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If 
anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold 
of the temple, he is bound by his oath.’ <sup>17</sup> You 
blind fools! Which is greater: the gold, or the temple that makes the gold 
sacred? <sup>18</sup> You also say, ‘If anyone swears by the 
altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by 
his oath.’ <sup>19</sup> You blind men! Which is greater: the 
gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred? <sup>20</sup> Therefore, 
he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
<sup>21</sup> And he who swears by the temple swears by it and 
by the one who dwells in it. <sup>22</sup> And he who swears by 
heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it. </p>
<p><sup>23</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and 
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices–mint, dill and cummin. 
But you have neglected the more important matters of the law–justice, mercy and 
faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the 
former. <sup>24</sup> You blind guides! You strain out a 
gnat but swallow a camel. </p>
<p><sup>25</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and 
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside 
they are full of greed and selfindulgence. <sup>26</sup> Blind Pharisee! First 
clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and 
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful 
on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything 
unclean. <sup>28</sup> In the same way, on the outside you 
appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and 
wickedness. </p>
<p><sup>29</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and 
Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the 
graves of the righteous. <sup>30</sup> And you say, ‘If we had 
lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in 
shedding the blood of the prophets.’ <sup>31</sup> So you 
testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered 
the prophets. <sup>32</sup> Fill up, then, the measure of the 
sin of your forefathers! </p>
<p><sup>33</sup> “You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will 
you escape being condemned to hell? <sup>34</sup> Therefore I 
am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill 
and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to 
town. <sup>35</sup> And so upon you will come all the righteous 
blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood 
of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the 
altar. <sup>36</sup> I tell you the truth, all this will come 
upon this generation. </p>
