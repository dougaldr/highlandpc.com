<p><sup>11</sup> While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a
parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought the kingdom of God
was going to appear at once.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup> He said: &quot;A man of noble birth
went to a distant country to have&nbsp; himself appointed king and then to
return.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> So he called then of his servants and gave them ten minas.
'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.'</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> &quot;But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after
him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> &quot;He was made king, however and returned home.&nbsp; Then he sent
for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they
had gained with it.</p>

<p><sup>16</sup> &quot;The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned
ten more.'</p>

<p><sup>17</sup> &quot;'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied.&nbsp; 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten
cities.'</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> &quot;The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five
more.'</p>

<p><sup>19</sup> &quot;His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'</p>

<p><sup>20</sup> &quot;Then another servant came and said, &quot;Sir, here is
your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.&nbsp; <sup>21</sup> I was
afraid of you, because you are a hard man.&nbsp; You take out what you did not put in
and reap what you did not sow'</p>

<p><sup>22</sup> &quot;His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words,
you wicked servant!&nbsp; You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I
did not put in, and reaping what i did not sow?&nbsp; <sup>23</sup> Why then didn't
you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it
with interest?'</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> &quot;Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away
from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'</p>

<p><sup>25</sup> &quot;'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'</p>

<p><sup>26</sup> &quot;He replied, 'I&nbsp; tell you that to everyone who has,
more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be
taken away.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup> But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be
king over them&#151;bring them here and kill them in front of me.'&quot;</p>
