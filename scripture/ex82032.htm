<p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Get 
up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to 
him, 'This is what the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
<sup>21</sup> If you do not let my people go, I 
will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into 
your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the 
ground where they are. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> &quot; 'But on that day I will deal 
differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies 
will be there, so that you will know that I, the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, am in this land.
<sup>23</sup> I will make a distinction  
between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.' &quot;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>24</sup> And the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> did this. Dense 
swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his 
officials, and throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and 
Aaron and said, &quot;Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> But Moses said, &quot;That would not 
be right. The sacrifices we offer the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> our God would be detestable to the 
Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will 
they not stone us? <sup>27</sup> We must take a 
three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> our God, as he 
commands us.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>28</sup> Pharaoh said, &quot;I will let you 
go to offer sacrifices to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> your God in the desert, but you must not go 
very far. Now pray for me.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> Moses answered, &quot;As soon as I 
leave you, I will pray to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh 
and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act 
deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>.&quot;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>30</sup> Then Moses left Pharaoh and 
prayed to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, <sup>31</sup> and the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> 
did what Moses asked: The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; 
not a fly remained. <sup>32</sup> But this time 
also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.</p>
