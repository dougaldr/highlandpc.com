<p>Christ was frequently involved in controversies.    We frequently see two patterns regarding the
controversial behavior/teaching of Christ and/or His apostles.    The first pattern begins with a
controversial act, then the Pharisees and/or Scribes challenge Him and complain about the act.  
Christ then silences them with a wise answer, but His accusers are never really satisfied; they
are just quieted down for a time.    The second pattern is a little different.  Christ plans to do the
controversial act, explains why He thinks it appropriate to do what He is about to do, and asks
for objections.   Since His reasoning is airtight, His enemies gnash their teeth and try to cook up
a scheme to kill Him.  Some of His most heated arguments were about the Sabbath Day.</p>

<p>The hallowing of the Sabbath Day finds its roots in the Creation Week when God rested on the
Seventh Day.   He was not, but His work was done.   The Torah says Israel was to rest every
Saturday.  I am sure it wasn't long until the question was raised, "What does and does not
constitute work?"     Rather than define when someone was clearly over the line, the Rabbis
offered a variety of rules to specify exactly where work began.   These rules were tedious and
dealt little with the attitude of the heart.    One rule (wisely) forbade reaping, but is pulling off a
few grains of barley, rubbing them, and then eating them "work."    Is speaking the word and
healing a man "work?"     Christ said, "No," and many of the Pharisees said, "Yes."    Christ and
His disciples clearly kept the Sabbath as defined in the Old Testament, but they did not obey
the traditions and added restrictions of the Pharisees.   So today many Christians obey church
traditions or the legalistic rules of men but disobey the clear precepts of the Word of God.</p>


<p>To the New Testament believer, every day is alike 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/rom145.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Romans 14:5</a>)
and no one is to pass
judgment on another about Sabbath Days 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/col21617.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Colossians 2:16-17</a>).  
If believers want to observe
the Sabbath, they may do so, but the New Testament believer is not required to do so.  The
Jews Rabbis took so much pride in their Sabbaths that they DISCOURAGED God-fearing
gentiles from observing the Sabbath (unless they became full converts to Judaism), so gentile
Christians never felt pressure to observe the Sabbath. </p>


<p>Down through the centuries, Christians have often met on the first day of the week
(Sunday—called, "The Lord's Day") in commemoration of the Resurrection.  This should not be
confused with the Sabbath.    The Sabbath Day cannot be changed; it is by definition the
Seventh Day, as defined not only in the Mosaic code but also through the Creation Week.  In
the early church (as we see in Acts), when most believers were Jewish, they would attend
synagogue on the Sabbath and meet with Messianic believers Saturday Night (the first day of
the week, our Sunday, began at sunset on our Saturday). </p>


<p>Because of passages like 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex311317.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Exodus 31:13-17</a>, 
Messianic Jews are divided as to whether it is God's
will for them to keep the Sabbath or not.    
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/rom145.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Romans 14:5</a> 
offers a position of tolerance for those
whose opinions differ on this matter.   The Sabbath Day will be instated during the Millennium
for all mankind 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/is5667.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Isaiah 56:6-7</a>). </p>
