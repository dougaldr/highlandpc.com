<p><sup>25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and
gave himself up for her <sup>26</sup> to make her holy, cleansing her by the
washing with water through the word, <sup>27</sup> and to present her to himself
as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but&nbsp;
holy and blameless.&nbsp; <sup>28</sup> In this same way, husbands ought to love their
wives as their own bodies.&nbsp; He who loves his wife loves himself.</p>
