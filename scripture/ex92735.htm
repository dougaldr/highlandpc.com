<p><sup>27</sup> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and 
Aaron. &quot;This time I have sinned,&quot; he said to them. &quot;The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> is in the right, 
and I and my people are in the wrong. <sup>28</sup> 
Pray to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; 
you don't have to stay any longer.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> Moses replied, &quot;When I have 
gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>. The 
thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth 
is the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>'s. <sup>30</sup> But I know that you 
and your officials still do not fear the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> God.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>31</sup> (The flax and barley were 
destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
<sup>32</sup> The wheat and spelt, however, were 
not destroyed, because they ripen later.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>33</sup> Then Moses left Pharaoh and 
went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>; the thunder and 
hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
<sup>34</sup> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and 
hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened 
their hearts. <sup>35</sup> So Pharaoh's heart 
was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had said 
through Moses.</p>
