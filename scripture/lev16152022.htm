<p><sup>15</sup> He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its 
blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bull's blood: He shall 
sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup> When Aaron has finished making atonement 
for the Most Holy Place, the Tent of Meeting and the altar, he shall bring 
forward the live goat. <sup>21</sup> He is to lay both hands on 
the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion 
of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat's head. He shall send 
the goat away into the desert in the care of a man appointed for the task.
<sup>22</sup> The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a 
solitary place; and the man shall release it in the desert. </p>
