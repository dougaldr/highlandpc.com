<p><sup>36</sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus 
himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”</p>   
<p><sup>37</sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking 
they saw a ghost. <sup>38</sup> He said to them, “Why are you 
troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? <sup>39</sup> Look 
at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have 
flesh and bones, as you see I have.” </p>
<p><sup>40</sup> When he had said this, he showed them his 
hands and feet. <sup>41</sup> And while they still did not 
believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything 
here to eat?” <sup>42</sup> They gave him a piece of broiled 
fish, <sup>43</sup> and he took it and ate it in their 
presence. </p>
