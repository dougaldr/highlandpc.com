<br>A Woman Who Knew How to Listen
<br><span class=byln><b>Notes on Matthew 26:1-13</b>
<br>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p><u>Do you know how to listen to others, and more importantly, to God?</u></p>
<p></p>
<ol type=I><li>Among the 
People Jesus Addressed, Many <b><u>Heard</u></b> But Few Listened. </p>
<ol><li>His disciples did not really <b><u>listen</u></b> 
though He spoke of His coming death repeatedly.</p>
<ol type=i><li>Passages in 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/matt1621.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Matthew 16:21</a>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/matt1722.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>17:22</a>; 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/matt201819.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>20:18-19</a>; and 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/matt2612.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>26:1-2</a>.</p>
<li>They heard WORDS, but did not grasp the <b><u>meaning</u></b>.</ol>
<li>The chief priests plotted, but did not really <b><u>understand</u></b>.
<br>Note a previous 
conversation in 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/john72021.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>John 7:20-21</a>.</p>
<li>Mary, sister of Martha and Lazarus, was the ONLY
<b><u>one</u></b> who understood Jesus was going to die 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/john1228.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>John 12:2-8</a>).</ol>
<li>What Made Mary 
Different?
<ol><li>She found TIME to listen (story of Mary and 
Martha); an eager learner.
<br>—teacher honored for her aggressive motivation to learn...
<br>—MARY was <b><u>self-motivated</u></b>, 
or more accurately, Spirit motivated.</p>
<li>A matter of priority.</p>
<li>Willingness to first UN <b><u>learn</u></b> to 
remove paradigm blindness.</ol>
<li>The Ministry 
Mary Had Because She Had Listened.
<ol><li>Ultimate act of WORSHIP.</p>
<li>Had the honor of <b><u>edifying</u></b>, <b><u>preparing</u></b> and 
<b><u>strengthening</u></b> CHRIST for the horrible 
trauma that lay ahead in two days.</ol></ol>
<p>
<u>People who listen can worship more deeply and be used more of God. People who 
don't listen lose much of what could have been.</u></p>
