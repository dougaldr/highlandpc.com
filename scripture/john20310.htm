<p><sup>3</sup> So Peter and the other disciple started for the 
tomb. <sup>4</sup> Both were running, but the other disciple 
outran Peter and reached the tomb first. <sup>5</sup> He bent 
over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
<sup>6</sup> Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and 
went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
<sup>7</sup> as well as the burial cloth that had been around 
Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.
<sup>8</sup> Finally the other disciple, who had reached the 
tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. <sup>9</sup> (They 
still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)
</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> Then the disciples went back to their homes.</p>
