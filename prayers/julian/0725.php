<p>All-Powerful Sovereign of the Universe,</p>
<p>Thank You that Your response to us once we are in Your 
family is in some ways unconditional, yet in other ways conditional. On 
the one hand, once we are in Christ, You see us &quot;in Him.&quot; We stand pure and 
clean. We have no condemnation if we are in Christ Jesus 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/rom81.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 8:1</a>). 
Yet, on the other hand, our fellowship with You can be broken by sin, the remedy of 
which is confession 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/1john179.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 John 1:7-9</a>).</p>
<p>So You are a God who responds to us sometimes 
conditionally, sometimes unconditionally. And, to make things more complex, 
sometimes You respond to us conditionally, but You have determined 
(unconditionally) to work within us so that we meet the conditions You prescribe 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/phil213.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Philippians 2:13</a>). 
So it all comes down to You.</p>
<p>As I just mentioned, Lord, First John says that if I 
confess my sins, You are faithful and&nbsp;just to forgive me those sins, and You 
will purify me from all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 John 1:9</b>). I confess the sins I am 
aware of now and I ask Your Spirit to search my heart (<i>Pause to admit them 
to God.</i>).</p>
<p>Lord, give me wisdom and blessing in the realm of 
finances. Help me to use my money wisely and realistically. Help me to give to 
support the Kingdom of God. May I be an example and testimony to others as to 
how serving the Lord frees one from materialism and irresponsible money 
management. If I am not an example now, help me to radically realign my thought 
process with the principles of God's Word.</p>
<p>Today I remember the persecuted church. I pray that the 
persecution would stop, that believers would be able to avoid persecution 
through Your guidance, but that they would trust in You when they cannot. Lord, 
please give them special grace. I pray for the following nations, that the 
governments and the population there would become more enlightened and recognize 
that religious freedom is every person's right. I pray for the 6-10<sup>th</sup> 
worse nations: Somalia, Pakistan, Yemen, Columbia, Nepal and North Sudan (not 
the entire nation).</p>
<p>I remember the African island nation of Sao Tome &amp; 
Principe. Although the overwhelming majority of the people profess a type of 
Christianity, over 90% of the babies are born out of wedlock. Thank You for the 
2.2% who claim to be born-again evangelicals; may their values translate into 
real life, I ask. Double the evangelical church within the next 5 years, I 
pray. May the believers there align their lives with Your Word, I ask.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for Reaching Indians Ministries International 
and their 530 (many indigenous) missionaries in India. Help them to make great 
progress in accomplishing their goal: &quot;To reach the unreached Indians in 
India and worldwide for Christ through Christian partnership.&quot; Bless their 
ministries of saturation evangelism and church planting, leadership development, and 
compassion services. Empower them by Your Spirit, provide, protect and help 
them, O Lord. Bless them with much fruit to Your glory.</p>
<p>Help me to remember You through my day, I ask in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
