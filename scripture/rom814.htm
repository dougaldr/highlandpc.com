<p><sup>1</sup> Therefore, there is now no 
condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
<sup>2</sup> because through Christ Jesus the law 
of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.
<sup>3</sup> For what the law was powerless to do 
in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, 
God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin 
offering. 
And so he condemned sin in sinful man,
<sup>4</sup> in order that the righteous 
requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to 
the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.</p>
