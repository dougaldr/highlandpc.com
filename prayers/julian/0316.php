<br>March 16

<p>Dear Lord,</p>
<p>I praise You, Jesus, that You are the church's Bridegroom. 
I am part of Your universal church; I became part of it the moment I turned from 
my sins and trusted Jesus Christ as my Savior. Your Spirit baptized me into 
Your body, the church. Elsewhere, You describe Yourself as the Bridegroom who 
will return someday without warning to take Your bride away. I look forward 
to that day, when I will feast with You and the all the redeemed at the Marriage 
Supper of the Lamb. Although this is imagery, I am grateful for the substance 
beyond the imagery: eternity in heaven in God's presence and in fellowship 
with the multitudes in glory. Even so come quickly, Lord Jesus!</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that You created our first parents, Adam 
and Eve, even knowing that they would sin. Thank You that by allowing their 
sin You have worked a greater good than would have been otherwise—at least as 
far as Your glory is concerned and as far as the destiny of those You have 
called. Surely You work out all things for the good for those who love God, for 
those who are called according to Your purpose. Our position having been 
redeemed is more glorious than that of Adam and Eve before the Fall.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to be encouraged by You and to encourage 
others. May others know me as a positive, encouraging person who can listen 
without spouting out unwanted advice. Teach me to listen to both You and 
others.</p>
<p>Lord, I am thankful for many things, three of which are: __________.
</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may 
fill me. I find my strength in His power, not my own. May Your Spirit control me 
today. I surrender my life afresh to Him.</p>
<p>I remember my enemies and those I do not really care for. 
I ask You to bless them, and if appropriate to grant them repentance. Help me 
to respond in a proper way to them. Help me to understand the difference 
between loving my enemy, my neighbor, my brother or sister in Christ, my spouse, 
children and family. Help me distinguish between the love of duty and a love 
that embraces emotionally. May I not make more stringent demands upon myself 
than You make upon me.</p>
<p>I pray for the nation of Denmark. Thank You for the 4.8% of 
the population that claim to be born-again evangelical Christians. Many of the 
people claim a formal form of Christianity, but they do not attend church and do 
not have a personal, living relationship with the Risen Christ. Please use the 
Jesus Film, the Danish Bible Society, and may Your Spirit also empower the new 
and promising Christian youth movement.</p>
<p>On another continent, thank You for Zion Evangelical Ministries of Africa which &quot;has 
formed a missionary partnership with TEAM and SIM to increase the work of the 
ministry&quot; in South Africa. Bless this work, keep it true to You, and provide 
resources, protection, and the blessing of Your Spirit.</p>
<p>I pray today for doctors around 
the world. They have a tough job with a lot of stress, and they must deal with 
many ethical issues. Help them to do what is right as You define right. May 
many come to know You, and help the doctors who do know You to share their faith 
with both patients and peers.</p>
<p>Now lead me today, I pray, in 
Christ's Name, Amen.</p>
