<br>Contending with Depression
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Dear Lord, like the Psalmist, I say, &quot;Out of the depths I cry to you, O
Lord.&quot; I do not enjoy being in these depths, Lord. I long for the days when
my feet were on level ground. I remember happier times and sometimes wonder
whether I will ever ascend back to them.</p>
<p>But in the gloom of despair and depression, I can cry to you, O Lord. And you
do hear. Often I wish you would just speak the word and lift me from the
lowlands. But such is rarely your way. No, you are broadening me, humanizing me,
taking the leather-like qualities out of my heart and rubbing it down, softening
it to conform to your gentleness. I despise the painfulness of depression and
the misery of discouragement, but I know its fruit cannot be duplicated any
other way.</p>
<p>Lord, depression is a symptom. Whether it be a result of wrong attitudes, a
change in the barometer, circumstances beyond my control, or body chemistry yet
to be discovered, it is frequently the lot of we Your adopted children. At times
like this I am painfully aware of how much I need you, of how meaningless life
is without you. But I am not without you. My life does have meaning because of
you.</p>
<p>Father, it seems all I can do at times is focus on the negatives:
disappointments, the anger I feel, or the frustration of my powerlessness to
change my plight. Sometimes I am tempted to fight or flight: but often you call
me to do neither, but to wait. Your Word encourages me time and time again to
wait upon you, the L<span class="footer">ORD</span>. Almighty, all-knowing One, I confess that I dislike
waiting upon you. I want you to act swiftly, to jump to my need as though you
were under my command, me the general and you the private. In reality, the
tables are turned: I am your servant, you are my Master. But even so, I despise
waiting. I wish I could press the fast forward button of life and zip over this
time, this bitterness of my soul. Instead you sometimes press the pause button,
and sometimes the waiting seems an eternity. You do this not because you are
cruel: Your love was demonstrated before a watching universe at Calvary. But I
don't understand. It doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>In the sinfulness and arrogance of my heart, I think I know better than you.&nbsp;
But such madness passes, and I am humbled before you once again.</p>
<p>Deep within me I know that it is worth the wait to see you work. It is worth
the wait to grow in patience. Sure, I would rather not grow and remain
immature&#151;if the choice were mine. Ease, comfort, and happiness are almost
always my preferences. But I only have one choice: to go through such times with
you by my side&#151;or without you. That's it. And though my emotions may be
confused, by faith I choose to go through these times with you. Your ways are
not mine, and when it is all over, I will rejoice and accept the fact that you
are truly all wise and all loving, though at times I cannot reconcile my
emptiness with your compassion. In eternity I believe it will make sense.&nbsp;
Only
then will I understand HOW all things work together for good.</p>
<p>But for now, I feel emotionally burdened. I am angry, discouraged,
frustrated, disgusted with it all. Thank you that you understand. Thank you that
your Son experienced anger when he threw over the money-changers' tables. He
experienced discouragement with the hardness and unbelief of even his own
disciples. He experienced frustration at Israel's rejection of him as he cursed
the fig tree. After his ascension, he was disgusted with some of his
churches&#151;and threatened to remove their candlesticks. During his earthly
pilgrimage, he was described as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</p>
<p>Yes, it is natural to get down. Thank you, Father, for not condemning me for
this, but leaving room for my emotions to fluctuate. Thank you, Son of God, that
you understand, not only by your infinite knowledge, but also by your own
experience. Thank you, Holy Spirit, that you understand my grief so thoroughly
that you bear the name &quot;Comforter.&quot; I need your consolation.&nbsp;
Like your
Son, Father, help me not to sin against you when I am down. Help me not seek
shortcuts that do not please you. Help me run time and again to you.</p>
<p>And so, Father, I walk through this desert with you. Lead me to an oasis
soon. Refresh my soul, and help me experience better days ahead. And if such is
not my lot in this life, help me to grasp a bit of the glory of heaven. Help me
borrow strength for today from my destiny of tomorrow. Help me see the brevity
of my time on earth in comparison to my eternity in heaven. And most of
all, dear God, thank you for saving my soul through the precious blood of Jesus
Christ my Lord, in whose name I pray, Amen.</p>
