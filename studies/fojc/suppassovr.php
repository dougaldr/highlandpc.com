<p>The Lord&#039;s Supper is often misunderstood because it is divorced from its Jewish 
context. The Jews had celebrated the Passover for about 1500 years before Jesus 
was born. Jesus took two elements from the Passover and instituted a memorial 
feast for all His followers. We call this memorial &quot;The Lord's Supper&quot; or 
&quot;Communion.&quot;</p>
<p>The 
purpose of the Passover was to memorialize God's deliverance of the Jews from 
the slavery of Egypt. The feast involved several elements, including four cups 
of wine (diluted with water), matzo (unleavened bread), bitter herbs and a lamb 
dinner.</p>
<p>
Several rituals are remarkably prophetic of the work of Jesus Christ. One of 
these practices involved the remarkable use of three matzos. The center matzo 
was hidden and not eaten until after dinner. When everyone had their fill of 
lamb, the children would search for the matzo; whoever found it would be awarded 
a prize. Then the family would eat this last matzo and drink another cup of 
wine. It was this part of the meal that Jesus transformed into the &quot;Lord's 
Supper.&quot;</p>
<p>The 
symbolism is remarkable. The three Persons of the Godhead are represented by 
the three matzos, which are wrapped in a cloth pouch called the &quot;afikomen.&quot; The 
second matzo, representing the Second Person of the Trinity (God the Son) was 
hidden from the Jews. But there is great reward for those who find Him, those 
with childlike faith.</p>
<p>When 
Jesus took that second matzo and broke it, He said, &quot;This is My body, given for 
you.&quot; He was NOT saying that the bread was turned into His body (for Christ's 
body had not yet been broken), but He was saying that &quot;you have been doing this 
ritual for years, not understanding what it means. This hidden matzo represents 
me and what I am about to do for you on the cross.&quot; Again, the Jews drank a cup 
of wine after the Passover meal, and Jesus now says, &quot;This cup is the new 
covenant in My blood.&quot; The Jews had long been anticipating the coming of the 
Messiah and the new covenant associated with His coming; this cup represented 
that new covenant, a covenant that would be ratified by blood (as all covenants 
were) within 24 hours. Again, the cup was not transformed into Jesus blood: 
Jesus had not yet shed His blood (and God forbids the drinking of blood both in 
the Old and New 
Testament—<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/acts1520.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Acts 15:20</a>).</p>
<p>By 
the way, the wording in all the Gospels state it was the &quot;cup&quot; that was the new 
covenant in His blood. Although most interpreters would understand this as a 
figure of speech (the cup represents the contents of the cup), another 
understanding could be, &quot;This ritual of taking the cup and drinking wine was 
meant to prefigure My work on the cross,&quot; (the emphasis being on the ritual and 
not the contents of the cup).</p>
<p>The 
ancient Feast of the Passover was the shadow and prophecy of what Christ was 
about to do. As the Passover looked forward, so we are clearly commanded to 
celebrate the Lord's Supper to look back on the finished work of Christ 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/1cor112327.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>1 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord's Supper is a special time of worship and remembrance. It does not save 
our souls, but it rather helps us focus on that holy point in time when Jesus 
Christ did save our souls by dying on the cross as the sacrificial Lamb of God, 
paying the penalty for our sins. It becomes easy to take our salvation for 
granted; God's command for us to celebrate the Lord's Supper was given to help 
us live in light of Calvary. But Communion only accomplishes this if we come to 
the table with open and sincere hearts.</p>
