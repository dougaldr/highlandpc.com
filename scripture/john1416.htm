<p>&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> &quot;Do not let your hearts be 
troubled. Trust in God; 
trust also in me. <sup>2</sup> In my Father's 
house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there 
to prepare a place for you. <sup>3</sup> And if I 
go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that 
you also may be where I am. <sup>4</sup> You know 
the way to the place where I am going.&quot;
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Thomas said to him, &quot;Lord, we don't 
know where you are going, so how can we know the way?&quot; 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> Jesus answered, &quot;I am the way 
and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."</p>
