Dear</p>
<p>
Greetings in the Name above all Names, our Lord Jesus Christ!  As we work 
together to build up one another and praise our Lord, it is important that we 
include many people in the process, for the Body is made up of many parts.   
That's why I am asking you to help as circled below:</p>

<p>
If there is a problem with the above, please communicate this to me promptly, 
preferably through a note in the Pastor's Box (using this very form is ideal) or 
through email<b>.  I always assume no news is good news.</b> If I do not hear 
from you, I assume we’re good to go.</p>
<p class="redbld">Special Note to Service Planners</p>
<p>
Our service begins at 10:30 and ends at 11:45 a.m.  <b><u>Please allow me a 
message time of 30 minutes!</u></b> Also note, when doing a responsive reading 
that it is great to have a second person for the congregation to follow.</p>
<p>
Every service should contain 1 to 2 hymns from the hymnal <b>and</b> a number of 
projected choruses.  Exceptions include times when we have a classical ensemble 
or the Christmas holiday season (We can do more or all hymns on those 
occasions.). </p>
<p><u><b>Ideal schedule:</b></u></p>
<p>
11:00   Offering and greeting time with Dismissal of children</p>
<p>
11:10               Ed begins preaching </p>
<p>
11:40               Ed finishes preaching</p>
<p>
11:42               Final song and dismissal</p>
<p>
Thank you so much.</p>
