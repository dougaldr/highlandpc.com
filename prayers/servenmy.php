<br>Serving in Enemy Territory

<p>Almighty King, how pleasant it is for me to turn my thoughts toward you.&nbsp;
As I
spend these few moments in prayer, I claim the helmet of salvation so that the
thoughts of my spirit may be offered as a time of communion with you unhindered.</p>
<p>Lord, you have called me and all who name the name of Yeshua, Jesus, to
represent you to an antagonistic world. And frankly, Abba Father, there are so
many enemy lines to hold and advance upon. There are heresies advancing within
the evangelical community; others claiming to be Christian but denying the basic
truths of your Word; others giving allegiance to one god but not the true God.&nbsp;
Then there are those who worship many gods, demonic forces, or no god at all.&nbsp;
There are philosophies advanced in the entertainment industry that fly in the
face of all your Word claims to be true. There are so few of your followers in
academia, and many of your followers place a low premium on thinking and
studying&#151;they neglect loving you with all their mind. Oh, Father, it is so
overwhelming!</p>
<p>Were that not enough, there are the traumatic failings of your leaders,
sometimes in very high places. And in addition to that, my own sins and areas of
immaturity constantly grieve me. Certainly the world, the flesh, and the devil
have formed a potent alliance! But you, O Lord, are sovereign. Your Son, our
Savior, is the victor. Thank you for sharing your victory with us. We await the
day when the victor's crown shall be ours, when we are dressed in white and join
the victory parade when Christ shall return to reign.</p>
<p>Yet, Lord, our task remains: to be your ambassadors in a world that rejects
the real you. Thank you, great Three in One, that it is not my job to right all
wrongs. All I need do is follow your will for this day, and then the next.&nbsp;
Empower me with your Spirit's constant filling that I might be fit for the task,
for in myself I am not only unworthy but inadequate. With your Spirit as my
guide, I am more than conqueror.</p>
<p>Encourage me when I am downtrodden. Motivate me when I cease to care.&nbsp;
Grant
me patience when I demand resolution. Break me of my demanding spirit, help me
see that my only rights are those you graciously bestow upon me. Keep me from
blaming others or circumstances for my sin. Help me not to minimize my sin by
contrasting it to the greater sins of some. Instead, as I am able to bear it,
help me see the ugliness of my own sin.</p>
<p>May my spouse and children know me as one who practices what he believes, who
is kind, balanced, and loves not only in word but in deed. Help me love my
family with my time and attention.</p>
<p>Yahweh, I thank you so much for sending your Son as my sin-bearer. As my
scapegoat, he bore the penalty for my sin so that I could stand perfectly
innocent and clean before you. Praise your name that he rose the victor, and
because he lives, I, too, shall live.</p>
<p>May your praise be in my mind, and may the meditation of my heart be
acceptable in your sight. In the name of the Messiah, Yeshua (Jesus), Amen.</p>
