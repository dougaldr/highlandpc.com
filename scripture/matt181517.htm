<p><sup>15</sup>  If your brother sins against you, go and show him his
fault, just between the two of you.&nbsp; If he listens to you, you have won your
brother over.&nbsp; <sup>16</sup> But if he will not listen, take one or two others
along, so that &quot;every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three
witnesses.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>17</sup> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the
church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a
pagan or a tax collector.</p>
