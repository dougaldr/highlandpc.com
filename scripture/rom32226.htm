<p><sup>22</sup> This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ
to all who believe. There is no difference, <sup>23</sup> for all have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God, <sup>24</sup>&nbsp; and are justified freely
by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. <sup>25</sup> God
presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did
this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins
committed beforehand unpunished-- <sup>26</sup> he did it to demonstrate his
justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those
who have faith in Jesus.</p>
