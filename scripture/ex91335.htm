<p><sup>13</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Get 
up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the 
L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship 
me, <sup>14</sup> or this time I will send the 
full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, 
so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
<sup>15</sup> For by now I could have stretched 
out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped 
you off the earth. <sup>16</sup> But I have 
raised you up  
for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be 
proclaimed in all the earth. <sup>17</sup> You 
still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
<sup>18</sup> Therefore, at this time tomorrow I 
will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was 
founded till now. <sup>19</sup> Give an order now 
to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of 
shelter, because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been 
brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.' &quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> Those officials of Pharaoh who 
feared the word of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock 
inside. <sup>21</sup> But those who ignored the 
word of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> left their slaves and livestock in the field. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>22</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, 
&quot;Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt--on 
men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.&quot;
<sup>23</sup> When Moses stretched out his staff 
toward the sky, the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to 
the ground. So the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> rained hail on the land of Egypt;
<sup>24</sup> hail fell and lightning flashed 
back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had 
become a nation. <sup>25</sup> Throughout Egypt 
hail struck everything in the fields--both men and animals; it beat down 
everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
<sup>26</sup> The only place it did not hail was 
the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and 
Aaron. &quot;This time I have sinned,&quot; he said to them. &quot;The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> is in the right, 
and I and my people are in the wrong. <sup>28</sup> 
Pray to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; 
you don't have to stay any longer.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>29</sup> Moses replied, &quot;When I have 
gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>. The 
thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth 
is the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>'s. <sup>30</sup> But I know that you 
and your officials still do not fear the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> God.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>31</sup> (The flax and barley were 
destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
<sup>32</sup> The wheat and spelt, however, were 
not destroyed, because they ripen later.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>33</sup> Then Moses left Pharaoh and 
went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>; the thunder and 
hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
<sup>34</sup> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and 
hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened 
their hearts. <sup>35</sup> So Pharaoh's heart 
was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had said 
through Moses.</p>
