<p><sup>33</sup> But a married man is concerned 
about the affairs of this world—how he can please his wife—
<sup>34</sup> and his interests are divided. An 
unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs: Her aim is to 
be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned 
about the affairs of this world—how she can please her husband.</p>
