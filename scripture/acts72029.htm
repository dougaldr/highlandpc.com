<p><sup>20</sup> At that time Moses was born, 
and he was no ordinary child. For 
three months he was cared for in his father's house.
<sup>21</sup> When he was placed outside, 
Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.
<sup>22</sup> Moses was educated in all the 
wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>23</sup> When Moses was forty years 
old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites.
<sup>24</sup> He saw one of them being mistreated 
by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the 
Egyptian. <sup>25</sup> Moses thought that his 
own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did 
not. <sup>26</sup> The next day Moses came upon 
two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, &quot;Men, 
you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> But the man who was 
mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, &quot;Who made you ruler and judge 
over us? <sup>28</sup> Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian 
yesterday?&quot;
<sup>29</sup> When Moses heard this, he fled to 
Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons. </p>
