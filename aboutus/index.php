<p> <b>Driving Directions</b>
<p> Highland Park Church is located near downtown Kokomo, <u>NOT near 
	Highland Park</u>. We are a little over a block north of Foster Park on the north 
	side of Sycamore Street. Our address is 516 West Sycamore Street.
<p>
	<b>From the South</b> (Indianapolis, for example): Take US 31 North to 
	IN 931 North to 
	Sycamore Street. Turn left (west) down Sycamore, passing through downtown 
	(about 1.5 miles). The church is on the right. When you cross Washington 
	Street, you are one block away.
<p>
	<b>Parking</b>: Turn right (north) on Webster Street to park in the church parking lot 
	behind the church building or park across Sycamore Street in the law offices lot. (We 
	are allowed to use that lot on weekends.)
<p>
	<b>From the North</b> (Peru, for example): Take US 31 South to IN 31 South to Sycamore 
	Street. Turn right (west) and follow the directions above.
<p>
	<b>From the West</b> (Burlington, for example): Take SR 22 East. Sycamore 
	Street is SR 22, so proceed toward town. The church is about 1.25 miles 
	East of Saint Vincent Kokomo Hosptial on the north side of the road. If you have 
	reached downtown, you have traveled too far. Note the parking directions 
	above.
<p>
	<b>From the East</b> (Greentown, for example): Follow SR 22 West. It will 
	jog and eventually turn into Sycamore Street just past downtown. When you turn 
	left (west) onto Sycamore Street, you are almost there, one block away. You will 
	see the church on your right. Note parking options above.
