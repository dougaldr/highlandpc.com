<br>The Sermon Preparation Revolution
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

	<p>When I first entered the ministry in 1979, I had been trained to prepare 
	expository sermons as pastors had done for generations. I developed a 
	handwritten outline with illustrations written on topically-numbered index 
	cards. Now my massive card file sits idle with its thousands of 
	illustrations, quotations, and statistics. Like a record player, my file has 
	become an unused vestige from another era. </p>
	<p>Some pastors have probably resisted the new technologies, while others, like 
	myself, have jumped in with both feet, while yet others are still testing 
	the waters. I urge readers not to fear technology, but to embrace it, 
	especially when it comes to sermon preparation and delivery. </p>
	<p>I compare modern sermon preparation to listening to an old-time radio 
	program over an MP3 player: we are preaching the old vintage story using 
	modern technologies. Let me share my story, one that is typical of the 
	sermon preparation revolution. </p>
	<p>Back in the old days, I began sermon preparation with prayer. That hasn't 
	changed! I would pull out some scratch paper and try to develop my main 
	points, leaving big gaps between them so I could later add my subpoints. I 
	would then develop a proposition (theme/central idea), just as I had been 
	taught. </p>
	<p>After I filled in the material with subpoints, it was on to the &quot;final 
	copy.&quot; That meant time to develop an introduction, neatly align my points, 
	add my illustration numbers (indexed to the cards) and produce a written 
	sermon outline, typically two half-sheets of paper in length. If I decided 
	to make some changes, I would forage in my drawer to locate the Wite-Out. 
	But technology has transformed many of these procedures. Traditional sermon 
	preparation has morphed into a new, but related creature. </p>
	<p>I became fluent with word processors over a dozen years ago. (Goodbye, Wite-Out.) 
	More recently, the video projector, CD libraries, and especially high-speed 
	Internet have twined themselves together to form a mighty cable of change! 
	So how does my sermon preparation look now? </p>
	<p>Since I take Saturdays off rather than Mondays, I begin my sermon 
	preparation Monday. After prayer and narrowing my text, my first step is to 
	copy and paste the sermon's text on my document. I copy the passage from
	<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/" target="offline" class="reg">BibleGateway</a>. 
	Before DSL (or high speed cable 
	service), I used a Bible program on CD; now, rather than hassle with booting 
	up a disk, I click my way to the website. Temporarily pasting the text on my 
	document allows me to see the text as I develop the sermon. When my sermon 
	is completed, I usually remove the text before printing. I may even copy and 
	paste text portions underneath the main points to help keep me on track. </p>
	<p>Like vintage sermon preparation, I still must develop my main points. 
	Depending upon the text, I may have to do some research before developing 
	the outline, which I do using the Internet. I subscribe to an inexpensive 
	library that has both classical and contemporary evangelical commentaries,
	<a href="http://www.biblecentre.net/" target="offline" class="reg">The Bible Centre</a>. 
	I still dust off the books from my own 
	shelves, but many of my best books—and a host of others—are included in the 
	online library. However, most times the outline jumps out at me, but I've 
	been doing this for 27 years! </p>
	<p>Then technology strikes again: once I have developed my title, my main idea, 
	my basic outline (main points and first level subpoints), I email a copy of 
	the outline to our video team for PowerPoint preparation, noting the words 
	to be inserted during the presentation by capitalizing them. The next day I 
	develop a corresponding sheet so listeners can &quot;fill in the blank,&quot; perhaps 
	also including a few cross-reference Scriptures, thus saving time during the 
	sermon. We insert copies of this sheet into our bulletins. </p>
	<p>Not every church has folks with the spiritual gift of &quot;technology geek.&quot; But 
	a frequent blessing of high technology is that it often includes members of 
	the body who are quiet or uninvolved in other ways. Some believers glow with 
	joy when seated in front of a laptop! </p>
	<p>At this point, I am ready to &quot;layer the sermon.&quot; Like an oil painter who 
	cannot leave his work alone, I keep dabbling with my sermon throughout the 
	week. At home, I connect to my office computer and add a thought here or an 
	illustration there. This &quot;layering&quot; has improved my sermons greatly, for the 
	creative juices flow when we are unhurried. </p>
<p>I might mine a few illustrations from the 
<a href="http://www.pulpithelps.com/" target="offline" class="reg">Pulpit Helps</a> 
website, the 
<a href="http://www.sermoncentral.com/" target="offline" class="reg">SermonCentral</a>
website, or other web resources, 
	including humor pages and news sites, great sources for introductory 
	material. </p>
<p>I print off my completed sermon on Friday. Instead of using index cards, I 
	paste my illustrations, quotations, or additional verses within my sermon's 
	text. Because of this, my sermon notes have put on weight. Instead of two 
	half-sheets, I typically scale the pulpit with a five-sheet outline. (Of 
	course, I use 1.5 line spacing so I can easily see my notes and that makes 
	it longer, too.) </p>
<p>Has the technology made a positive difference? Absolutely! With &quot;fill in the 
	blank&quot; sheets, listeners find it easier to pay attention and retain. 
	Projection significantly improves the learning process. With neater and more 
	complete notes, I rarely get tangled up or forget what I meant to say. </p>
<p>Technology is a nuisance to learn, expensive to acquire, and challenges our 
	long-established routines. But the payback is worth it. Technology should 
	never replace the centrality of God's Word; in some circles, unfortunately, 
	it has. To those of us who believe lives are transformed only as minds are 
	renewed in God's Word, technology can bolster our communication of that 
	Word. </p>
<p>It is amazing how the Holy Spirit, coffee, and technology can work together!</p>
