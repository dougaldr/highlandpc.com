<p>Majestic Lord,</p>
<p>I give thanks and praise to You, for Your lovingkindness 
lasts forever. I cannot tell others of all Your works for they are beyond me in 
both volume and quality. Your blessing is with those who practice 
righteousness and You have a special love for those Who are (or will be) in 
Your family. Thank You for Your favor toward us.</p>
<p>Lord, when I read the history of Israel and how they sinned 
in the wilderness with their doubts, complaining and hard hearts, I must admit 
that I am sometimes like them. I love to complain, I find it easy to doubt and 
sometimes my heart is not as open to You as it should be. You delivered them by 
opening up the Red Sea and You deliver me in so many ways in some many 
situations. Thank You for the ultimate deliverance: my new birth which results 
in my salvation. Thank You that I am a new creation in Jesus Christ. Help me 
to live accordingly, I ask.</p>
<p>Father, there can be two of me: the normal me and the me 
in conflict. When I am at odds with others, I can be tempted to be less than 
fair and objective; I find it easy to reconfigure the past to fit my agenda; I 
can easily justify self-centeredness and dismiss reasonableness and integrity. 
O Lord, may the &quot;conflicted me&quot; and the &quot;at peace me&quot; 
be the same: honest, fair, 
balanced, willing to admit faults. You only have one Bible, one set of 
demands. Remind me that I am not &quot;excused of Christian values&quot; 
just because I 
am in the midst of conflict. Keep me from viewing those opposed to me as 
totally evil while viewing those who agree with me as totally good.</p>
<p>O, Lord, please bring help to the hurting, the emotionally 
wounded and the devastated. Strengthen those stung by disappointment, 
encourage the demoralized and bind up the emotionally wounded. Especially 
help: __________.</p>
<p>Today I pray for the Shaanxi Province of China with its 37 
million people. Although estimates of the number of Christians vary from 1% to 
10%, that variance itself indicates that the church is growing quickly. O Lord, 
prosper Your Word in this area! May Your Spirit grant many the repentance that 
leads to life. May the number of believers double over the next five years and 
may the government recognize the freedom You give to all people.</p>
<p>Lord, thank You for the ministry of JEMS International. 
&quot;JEMS has expanded beyond just the Japanese and Japanese Americans. JEMS 
ministries now includes other Asian Americans...doing the work of evangelism, 
discipleship, teaching the Word, training, equipping, unifying the believers and 
churches. JEMS can be described by its four distinctive ministries. 
international (mission) ministry: Japan and South America...campus ministry: 
AACF...specialized 
ministry: Mount Hermon Summer Conference and...support coordination ministry: 
headquarter staff to provide the support for the field ministries mentioned 
above.&quot; Lord, prosper, provide and protect this ministry. Grant them a great 
harvest and the power of Your Spirit. May an attitude of harmony prevail within 
the organization.</p>
<p>Now help me to get along well with others. Keep me from 
complaining except when I need to confront, I pray in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
