<br>The New Millennium

<p>Our gracious heavenly Father, Lord of time, Lord of all creation, and Lord of
our hearts, we praise and thank you for being the God of our past and the God of
our present. We ask you to help us trust you to be the God of our future.</p>
<p>You have carried us through time, Gentle Shepherd. Sometimes we've been
beaten down, battered and incoherent. You've been present with your people
through wars, famines, plagues, disasters, heartaches, and disappointments.&nbsp;
You
watch with joy as we revel in life's blessings and pleasures. You have rejoiced
with us when we have rejoiced, You have wept with us when we have wept.</p>
<p>You have watched our families grow from infancy to old age, new generations
solemnly taking the place of previous generations. You have seen our sins and
the sins of all mortals time and time again. You are familiar with the ugliness
of human arrogance and appalled at the frequency of human callousness.</p>
<p>In all times, good and bad by human standards, you have reserved a remnant
for yourself. Thank you for drawing many of us to repentance and faith in our
Savior, your Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Remind us that all we need do in the
days and years ahead is obey him.</p>
<p>We sense the miniscule amount of influence we have in this world. We realize
that many situations are totally beyond our control. Help us to trust you, the
Lord of time, history, and redemption. Help us rekindle a vision of a sovereign
God, a God untouched by technology or the schemes of men, untouched by time,
ever the same. So it is with confidence in you, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
that we enter into a new millennium, eagerly waiting for the ultimate
Millennium, when our Lord Jesus shall return to reign from Zion.</p>
<p>Like Paul, help us do this one thing: forgetting what lies behind and
pressing onward toward the goal of pleasing the Lord Jesus Christ, in whose
ever-potent name we pray, Amen.</p>
