<p><sup>53</sup> When Jesus had finished these 
parables, he moved on from there. <sup>54</sup> Coming 
to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were 
amazed. &quot;Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?&quot; they 
asked. <sup>55</sup> &quot;Isn't this the carpenter's 
son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon 
and Judas?&quot;</p>
