<p>Very soon, Hollywood will 
release a fiction movie titled <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. The movie is based on 
the best-selling fiction book of the same title. The claims of the story 
contradict history and involve some blasphemous conjectures. The story claims 
that Jesus did not claim to be God and that such a belief was not propagated 
until the fourth century (This is absolute nonsense.). It also claims that Jesus 
was married to Mary Magdalene and had several children, which coincides with 
Mormon belief, although Mormons believe He had several wives.</p>
<p>Although these claims are 
absurd, gullible people will fall for them. However, they will also produce 
positive results as we will be forced to think more deeply about defending our 
faith. The systematic defense of our beliefs is called &quot;Christian 
Apologetics.&quot; Apologetics (which has nothing to do with saying, &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; 
but more like, &quot;I'm not sorry&quot;) involve answering questions or objections to 
Biblical doctrine, setting forth a positive case for Christianity, or creating a 
climate suitable for discussing the claims of Christ.</p>
<p>Most of us cannot argue 
apologetics on a high level, but all of us should be able to answer some of the 
most basic questions with simple, non-technical answers. So let me ask you, how 
would you answer the following questions: 1) How do I know the Bible is true? 
2) Aren't all religions equal? 3) If there is a God, why do disasters happen? 
If you are not sure, read on. But do more than read on: learn the material 
below.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the first 
question: <b>&quot;How do I know that the Bible is true?&quot;</b> The simplest answer for 
this one is the existence of the nation of Israel. The Bible tells us that 
Israel must survive because that nation plays a key role in the end times. Yet 
there was no nation of Israel from 70 A.D. (when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem) 
until 1948, when the U.N. proclaimed a Jewish state. Not only does their 
survival indicate the truth of Scripture, but the attempts to annihilate them 
evidence that another force is at work to prevent end-time events from 
occurring.</p>
<p>Another hands-on proof for the 
truth of Scripture is fulfilled Bible prophecy. We have copies of the Old 
Testament that are dated before the time of Christ, and the Jewish Bible is the 
same as the Christian Old Testament. Jesus fulfilled these prophecies, and 
there are too many and some are so specific that they could not have been 
fulfilled through coincidence. The prophecies predict the city in which Christ 
was born 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/mic52.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Micah 5:2</a>), 
His death, burial, and resurrection (<b>Isaiah 53</b>), and a 
host of other details.</p>
<p>The second question, <b>
&quot;Aren't all religions equal?&quot;</b> is really based on some wrong assumptions. 
The question itself implies: &quot;Since religions are pretend anyway, the purpose of 
religion is what it does for you or society.&quot; The problem is that Christianity 
is not a philosophy with some made-up miracles added on. Christianity is 
founded upon miracles and history, particularly the resurrection of Christ. If 
we believe that Christ rose from the dead, He is clearly authoritative in what 
He says. He is Lord, the Master, the one who has more authority than any 
others. And Christ taught that He was the only way to God 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john146.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 14:6</a>). 
Christianity is not true because it works in lives, but, rather, it works in 
lives because it is true. If Christ did not rise from the dead, then 
Christianity is a false religion and offers a false hope. Jesus is either Lord, 
liar, or lunatic. </p>
<p>The separation of religious 
truth from actual history and logic comes from the assumption that religion is 
in the realm of pretending (which might be the actual belief of most religious 
people, although they would not put it so bluntly). Although Biblical 
Christianity does include a philosophy of life, it is a factual faith based on 
tangible and physical events in history. Just as 2+2=4, the Bible presents 
spiritual truth in the same manner. We do not have a &quot;2+2= 
whatever-works-for-you.&quot; No, 2+2=4 whether you like it or not, believe it 
or not, or want it or not. We must come to a verdict: Biblical Christianity is 
either true or false.</p>
<p>The third question, <b>&quot;If there is a God, why do bad things 
happen?&quot;</b> presents a great opportunity for 
the Christian to show how the Christian faith is consistent with reality. 
Whereas some religions teach that evil is an illusion, while others teach that 
there is no real difference between good and evil, Christians believe that evil 
exists. Evil is the spoiling of the good. Whatever God creates is good, but He 
created creatures (man is among them) with the ability to choose the good or to 
spoil the good (evil). Because mankind chose evil, God has cursed His creation 
(all of nature). Part of that curse includes natural disasters.</p>
<p>But God knew this would all 
happen from the beginning. He planned a way to redeem this cursed creation by 
sending Jesus Christ to bear our sin and rise again. When we accept Christ, we 
are better off than we would have been without a cursed creation. God works a 
greater good by allowing evil now 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/rom828.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 8:28</a>). 
Although we cannot understand how specific events contribute toward a greater 
good, the curse upon creation is 
temporary and will produce something all the better&#196;for those who love God.</p>
<p>Therefore, evil is real, and 
we have hearts that are deceitful and desperately wicked 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/jer179.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Jeremiah 17:9</a>). 
The newspaper headlines are consistent with a Christian worldview.</p>
<p>Obviously, we could go much 
deeper into each of these matters, and there are hundreds of other questions 
people could and do ask, such as &quot;Did Christ really rise from the dead?&quot; or &quot;How 
old is the universe?&quot; Fortunately, our church library is stocked with a big 
Apologetics section and a Creationism section for further study. If you have 
access to the Internet, the
<a href="http://www.christiananswers.net" class="reg" target="offline">www.christiananswers.net</a> website can get you started.</p>
<p>Peter exhorts us, &quot;Always be 
prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the 
hope that you have&quot; (<b>1 Peter 3:15</b>). Let me encourage you, if you cannot answer 
the above questions off the top of your head, study the material above until it 
flows. If you cannot understand the concepts, &quot;say the words,&quot; and then you 
will probably catch on to the concepts. Only the minority of us will delve 
deeply into apologetics, but all believers need to know these ABCs.</p>
