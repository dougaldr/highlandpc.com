<p>My Master and My God,</p>
<p>Lord, You are the Governor of the Universe. You are the 
Director, the Ruler, the Overseer Who holds sway over everything and everyone. 
You administer and superintend based upon Your character. You have every right 
to exercise authority. You maintain the laws of physics and the laws which 
govern the souls of people balancing grace and justice. Indeed under Your 
reign, &quot;Love and faithfulness meet together; righteousness and peace kiss each 
other&quot; (<b>Psalm 85:10</b>).</p>
<p>Thank You that one day there will be a New Heaven and a 
New Earth. The old creation will be burnt up. There will be no taint of the 
curse but only truth and righteousness and joy and peace. As one who has 
accepted Jesus Christ as personal Savior, I need not fear the Lake of Fire, the 
destiny of the lost. Heaven is my home because all my sins have been washed 
away by Christ's sacrifice on the cross.</p>
<p>Lord, Your Word tells me that a wise man is eager for 
instruction; he or she wants to learn and is open to correction. Help me not 
react to criticism especially when it is not someone's cruel lashing. Remind 
me to thank the critic and to mull over how true or untrue a comment is. 
Please keep me from becoming defensive; I cannot become a wise person if I take 
that posture.</p>
<p>I pray for the biggest challenge I seem to be facing my 
life right now. I ask You to work in the situation, to strengthen me through my 
trials. </p>
<p>I pray for my lost friends and family members, including: __________. 
Father, please send Your Spirit to draw them to Yourself and grant&nbsp;them the 
repentance that leads to life.</p>
<p>I pray for Christians who are straying from their first 
love or compromising their walk with You. Rekindle the faith they once 
professed and help them fervently love the Savior once again. Remove their 
boring view of serving You and help them see the adventure and fulfillment of 
walking daily in Your light. Stir up their hearts and help them make the 
routines of godliness a part of their lives. I especially remember: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, the African nation of Equatorial Guinea has had 
several traumatic decades of communist repression, and even though no longer 
communist, it is still a one-party nation. Thank You that religious freedom has 
begun to surface; I pray that eventually the government will recognize 
complete religious freedom. Thank You for the 3.2% of the nation who claim to 
be born-again evangelicals. Thank You for some great progress in Bible 
translation. May the number of believers quadruple over the next decade, help 
the church to develop solid and strong leaders, and may Your Spirit draw many 
people to Yourself in that land.</p>
<p>I remember OC International in prayer. Their mission and 
strategy is to &quot;mobilize godly and effective Church leaders to reach all 
nations by means of research, motivation and training.&quot; Thank You for the, &quot;425 
missionaries impacting over 60 countries.&quot; May they walk in harmony, pleasing 
You, and filled by Your Spirit so that they may be effective. Provide for them, 
empower them, protect them and bless them with great fruit.</p>
<p>Now, Lord, help me give discreet answers today, I pray, in 
Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
