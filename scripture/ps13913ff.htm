<p><sup>13</sup> For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.&nbsp;
<sup>14</sup> I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your
works are wonderful, I know that full&nbsp; well.&nbsp; <sup>15</sup> My frame was not
hidden from you when I was made in the secret place.&nbsp; When I was woven together
in the depths of the earth, <sup>16</sup> your eyes saw my unformed body.&nbsp; All
the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to
be.</p>
