  <p>I&#39;ve always joked that the Greek Orthodox folks must be the
  best penny pinchers in the world. They celebrate Christmas in January&#196;after
  all the decorations are half priced and the big clearance sales are on! Of
  course, most of those folks celebrate a gift exchange on December 25<sup>th</sup>
  and celebrate the religious aspect of Christmas in January, so they get stuck
  with the big bills like the rest of us! How does that hymn go? &#34;I heard the
  bills on Christmas Day&#34;? Oh, that&#39;s supposed to be <i><b>bells</b></i>. That&#39;s
  what we call &#34;an intentional Freudian slip.&#34;</p>

  <p>Some things do come at the wrong time, however. This is
  particularly true within the evangelical world. By all rights, this should be
  celebration time for those of us who have remained firmly committed to the
  faith of the Bible. Recent findings in the realms of archaeology and science
  have vindicated the faith of Bible-believing Christians. Sadly, much of the
  evangelical world is no longer interested in the Bible as it once was. Hence,
  no celebration.</p>
  <font size="1">
  </font>
  <p>For years, serious evangelical Christians have held the
  Biblical line, despite defections from other branches of Christendom. While
  liberal Protestantism and Catholicism were embracing the theory of evolution
  over billions of years of time, we kept the faith. While those groups were
  saying that the Bible was filled with historical or geographical errors, we
  disagreed. And we took a lot of razzing: much of it was far from good natured.&nbsp;
  We were labeled mindless, naive, gullible, extreme, and as refusing to accept
  reality. But things are changing&#196;rapidly. The old mockeries no longer work
  because wisdom is being vindicated by her children.</p>
  <font size="1">
  </font>
  <p>Now even one of the greatest adversaries of the Christian
  perspective, the liberal PBS network, aired the videos, &#34;Unlocking the Mystery
  of Life&#34; and &#34;Icons of Evolution,&#34; videos which present strong arguments for
  intelligent design. The more we unravel the mystery of life, the more we see
  the hand of God. He is becoming inescapable, even to the resistant. The recent
  perfecting of carbon dating has argued for dates more compatible with recent
  creation than with billions of years of random evolution. Although still
  taught as dogma, the theory of evolution is getting ready to totter, much like
  the Soviet Union before its collapse. The dogma remains, but the experimental
  belief itself has proven a disaster.</p>

  <p>Within the last decade, the real Mount Sinai has been
  discovered in Saudi Arabia, complete with charred top, a split rock that at
  one time was at the head of a reservoir of water (in an area that get one half
  inch of rain every ten years), and the remnants of Aaron&#39;s golden calf altar. The presence of the Hebrews in Egypt as slaves has been documented, and strong
  evidence exists for the location of the crossing of the Red (not Reed) Sea.&nbsp;
  Via video tape, we at HPC (i.e., the Sunday night bunch) have actually seen
  these things. What a wonderful time to study the Bible! Our forefathers could
  only dream of seeing such things. But we can actually view them!</p>
  <font size="1">
  </font>
  <p>Sodom and Gomorrah have been found, and they were indeed
  destroyed by fire and sulfur. Although skeptical archaeologists refuse to
  believe that the source of the fire is heaven, the facts prove that those
  cities were destroyed as the Bible says they were. For over a century, liberal
  scholars claimed that Sodom and Gomorrah never even existed. That is, up until
  the 1990&#39;s. </p>
  <font size="1">
  </font>
  <p>But the saddest thing about all this is that most
  Christians are unaware of these great breakthroughs, and, even sadder, most
  Christians do not even care! Although we evangelicals have grown in number, we
  are not as deep as we used to be.</p>
  <font size="1">

  <p>An article appeared in the October 30, 2003 Indianapolis
  Star. They interviewed Alan Wolfe, author of <u>One Nation After All</u>. Wolfe, who is a liberal Jew, writes about America&#39;s diverse yet unified
  religious approaches; of evangelicals, the Indy Star summarizes and quotes
  Wolfe, &#34;Much of the music entertains&#8230;Sermons have &#39;remarkably little actual
  content&#39; however dynamic the delivery. The Bible is cited, but rarely
  explored.&#34; I think it is amazing that the world can see what many Christians
  and Christian leaders do not care to see: we have lost our content because we
  cite but do not study. We do not seek to understand the Bible nor doctrine.</p>
  <font size="1">
  </font>
  <p>These recent discoveries, which could have sparked a
  revival thirty or forty years ago, is of no interest to many of our brothers
  and sisters in Christ. But for those of us who are Psalm 1 kind of Christians&#196;who meditate day and night on God&#39;s Word&#196;what a wonder it is! What a
  great time to be a Bible Christian! How grand it is!</div>
