<p><sup>17</sup> This is what the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> says: By this 
you will know that I am the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>: With the staff that is in my hand I will 
strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.
<sup>18</sup> The fish in the Nile will die, and 
the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.' &quot; </p>
<p><sup>19</sup> The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Tell 
Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over 
the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs'-and they will 
turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden buckets and 
stone jars.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>20</sup> Moses and Aaron did just as the 
L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his 
officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into 
blood. <sup>21</sup> The fish in the Nile died, 
and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood 
was everywhere in Egypt. </p>
