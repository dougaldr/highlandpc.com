<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show 
them that they should always pray and not give up. <sup>2</sup> He 
said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared 
about men. <sup>3</sup> And there was a widow in that town who 
kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’”</p>   
<p><sup>4</sup> “For some time he refused. But finally he 
said to himself, ‘Even though I don't fear God or care about men,
<sup>5</sup> yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will 
see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her 
coming!’ ” </p>
<p><sup>6</sup> And the Lord said, “Listen to what the 
unjust judge says. <sup>7</sup> And will not God bring about 
justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep 
putting them off? <sup>8</sup> I tell you, he will see that 
they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find 
faith on the earth?” </p>
