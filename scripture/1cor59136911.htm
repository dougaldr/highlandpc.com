<p><sup>5:9</sup>  I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually 
immoral people— <sup>10</sup> not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this 
world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to 
go out of the world. <sup>11</sup> But now I am writing to you not to associate 
with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality 
or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with 
such a one. <sup>12</sup> For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not 
those inside the church whom you are to judge? <sup>13</sup> God judges those 
outside. “Purge the evil person from among you.”</p>
<p><sup>6:9</sup> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the 
kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, 
nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, <sup>10</sup> nor thieves, nor 
the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of 
God. <sup>11</sup> And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were 
sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the 
Spirit of our God.</p>
