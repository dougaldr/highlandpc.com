<p>Dear God,</p>
<p>Our hearts are in shock. We cannot believe the reports of 
disaster we hear. Somehow, it seems like some futuristic science fiction 
movie. But it is reality. Massive death: men, women, and children. Entire 
families wiped out without warning.</p>
<p>Lord, we work so hard to keep people alive. We try to 
develop medicines, encourage healthy diets, and promote caution. We value human 
life because You value human life. And then, in a moment, disaster strikes and many lives are 
snuffed out in minutes.</p>
<p>Father, we know this world is cursed, and that curse 
includes natural disasters. You sit as Sovereign Lord over the universe, so 
these tragedies perplex us. We know Your wrath in general is revealed through 
natural disasters, but we also know that the victims of this disaster were no 
worse than the rest of us. Things seem to happen so randomly. </p>
<p>Lord, we know You have a master plan that makes sense of 
these things. We admit to being at a loss. We know Your ways are higher than 
our ways, and we know that, in the end, a greater good will come about, a good 
that could not be were it not for the tragic events of history. Though 
perplexed and puzzled, we still trust You as the holy, good, and sovereign Lord 
that You are. We know that, ultimately, we experience these events with You at 
our side and with the consciousness of a better destiny awaiting us, or we 
experience these events alone and in a state of hopelessness. We choose to take 
Your hand.</p>
<p>We pray for the survivors. We pray that You would heal 
their bodies and keep them healthy. We pray that You would help them cope with 
the horrendous losses, the trauma, the pain, the misery of it all. May many 
come to find You through this tragedy. </p>
<p>Lord, we cannot imagine the grief of an individual who has 
lost a loved one or perhaps and entire family. Our hearts bleed for the 
children, the poor children! Oh God, we have run out of words to pray!</p>
<p>Please help the relief teams. Give them health, wisdom, 
emotional and physical energy. May their efforts be multiplied and their 
efficiency increased. Provide the necessary provisions and the means to get the 
supplies to match the needs, wherever victims may be. We pray things would not 
grow worse than they already are.</p>
<p>Our Father, as fellow human beings, we can only try to 
place ourselves in the shoes of these suffering ones for but a few seconds or 
our own hearts will break. But in Your compassion, O God, please stay the 
plague and show Your grace to all.</p>
<p>We pray in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
