<p>Misunderstanding can lead to creativity. &quot;Bell was inspired to start 
development of the telephone when he read an account, written in German, 
describing an invention which he thought had the function of a telephone. After 
demonstrating his first working telephone Bell learned that, because of the 
language barrier, he had misunderstood the report, and the German invention had 
an entirely different function.&quot;

Examples</a>)</p>
<p>One big obstacle to inventing things is believing that a desired invention is 
possible. Since Bell believed the telephone was possible, his mind opened up.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best way to succeed is to fail. </p>
<p>The relationship between electricity and magnetism was first observed in 1820 
by Oersted in a public lecture at which he was demonstrating the &quot;well known 
fact&quot; that electricity and magnetism were completely independent phenomena. This 
time the experiment failed! An electric current produced a magnetic effect. 
Oersted was observant enough to notice this effect, honest enough to admit it, 
and diligent enough to follow up and publish.</p>
<p>Moses was in that predicament. He tried his best to bring the children of 
Israel out of Egypt. But God intended Moses to fail until the ante was upped.</p>
<p>As a result, Moses failed, plague after plague, miracle after miracle, 
because God wanted something bigger than Moses wanted. And failure was the only way to 
get there.</p>

<ol type=I><li><p><b>Moses' First Attempt with Pharaoh Bombed.</b> (5:1-23)</p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Pharaoh laughed it off.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>An 80 year old man and an 83 year old slave stand before the 
	most powerful man in the world at that time.</p>
<li><p>The Pharaoh was visiting the Nile Delta.</p>
<li><p>Pharaoh had probably heard of Yahweh, but the Pharaoh was thought to be a 
god himself, so he did not recognize Yahweh as a legitimate god.</p>
<li><p>God wanted Pharaoh to laugh it off; success, remember, is not measured by 
immediate results, but by long term- and eternal- consequences!</p></ol>
<li><p>The Israelites were more miserable than ever.</p>
<li><p>Moses lost what confidence he had. (5:23)</p>
<p>Moses scolded God!</p>
<p>John Davis writes, &quot;We should not regard the response of Moses to his God as 
being irreverent or insubordinate, but these were words of a searching heart…&quot;</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Nonsense. Such statements reflect an era of evangelicalism we have gladly 
left behind. The era of sterilizing the Scripture to make it fit the molds we 
want it to fit.</p>
<li><p>The truth is that Moses was very human, and sometimes his attitude stank, 
but God worked with him anyway.</p>
<li><p>You don't change reality with verbiage.</p>
<li><p>We call this &quot;armchair theology&quot; </p>
<p>And God does not fault him.</p>
<p>Sometimes it must get worse before it gets better; short-term failures can be 
steps to long term and greater successes.</p></ol></ol>
<li><p><b>God Reassured Moses: &quot;We're On Track.&quot;</b> (6:1-30)</p>
<ol type=A><li><p>God's plan had been unwavering from the start.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p><b>6:1</b>, &quot;Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, 
'Now you will see what I will do to 
Pharaoh: Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty 
hand he will drive them out of his country.'&quot;</p>
<li><p>It's like that game show, &quot;Let's Make A Deal.&quot; God is after the big prize; 
He doesn't have to worry about playing it safe, because He knows what is behind 
every curtain.</p></ol>
<li><p>Guaranteed by God's good Name.</p>
<p>The proper interpretation of <b>6:3</b>,
&quot;And by my Name, Yahweh, did they not know me?&quot;</p>
<li><p>Deliverance would come only after judgment. (6:6)</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>It was not enough for God to deliver the Hebrews.</p>
<li><p>He wanted to vindicate His good Name and prove Himself superior to their 
gods.</p>
<li><p>God wanted to show off!</p>
<li><p>He wanted to punish the Egyptians.</p>
<li><p>He also wanted the Hebrews to have wealth.</p></ol></ol>

<li><p><b>God Worked a Miracle of Respect</b> (7:1-13)</p>
<p>Why didn't Pharaoh throw Moses and Aaron in jail or execute them? Nothing short 
of a miracle!</p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Moses was afraid to approach Pharaoh again.</p>
<li><p>God's miracle: Moses like God, Aaron like God's prophet.</p>
<li><p>They approach Pharaoh with the rod.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Rod turned to a serpent</p>
<li><p>Egyptians able to do same. How? (paralyzed snake)</p>
<li><p>Moses ate theirs up.</p>
<li><p>Pharaoh is not impressed. Moses' presentation has failed again.</p></ol></ol>

<li><p><b>Short-term Success Can Mean Long-Term Failure.</b></p>
<ol type=A><li><p>God's goal: not a 3-day religious holiday, but freedom.</p>
<p>By all human standards, Jesus was a failure.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Own brothers did not believe.</p>
<li><p>Own people group did not by and large believe.</p>
<li><p>Ended up rejected and crucified.</p>
<li><p>But that failure brought salvation to mankind.</p></ol>
<li><p>Only God sees the ultimate big picture.</p>
<p>A pilot is flying over a mountainous terrain, and as he's flying, he looks 
down to see two vehicles driving down the highway.</p>
<p>The first vehicle is a semi-trailer, pulling his load up and down that 
highway. The second vehicle is a sports car driven by a guy who's got better 
things to do than be stuck behind a semi that can't always maintain the speed 
limit up the mountain grades.</p>
<p>Well, what the pilot can see that the drivers can't is that there is no 
traffic coming the other way. The car could easily pass the truck with no 
danger.</p>
<p>The problem is that neither the truck nor the car driver can see that. They 
can only see what's immediately in front of them.</p>
<p>They can't see the big picture.</p>

<li><p>One of our greatest weaknesses: shortsightedness.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>If there is one thing that separates the mature from the immature, it is 
the matter of shortsightedness.</p>
<li><p>If there is one thing that separates the wise Christian from the foolish 
Christian, it is shortsightedness.</p>
<li><p>Tom doesn't want to bother with college; he wants a car and a girl, so he 
goes to work out of high school. Larry goes to college or trade school. Years 
later, Larry has a good wife, a nice home, and some wonderful children. Tom is 
between girlfriends and fending off the creditors.</p>
<li><p>Doesn't always turn out this way, but often does. Difference: short-term 
or long-term perspective.</p></ol></ol></ol>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>I'll present the following scenarios. Tell me if they are good or bad.</p>
<ul><li><p>A famous pastor who has been at a church for years and seen great growth 
retires, and a young, untrained man takes his place. Good or bad? Depends. John Gill 
and Charles Spurgeon.</p>
<li><p>A woman is widowed and remarries later in life. Martha Washington.</p>
<li><p>A man barely scrapes out a living as a shoe salesman and answers the call to 
ministry. D.L. Moody.</p>
<li><p>An aspiring student is accepted into Harvard but flunks out. Bill Gates.</p></ul>
