<p><sup>6</sup> For you are a people holy to the 
L<span>ORD</span> your God. The L<span>ORD</span> your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the 
face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>7</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> did not set his 
affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other 
peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
<sup>8</sup> But it was because the L<span>ORD</span> loved 
you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with 
a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of 
Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p>
