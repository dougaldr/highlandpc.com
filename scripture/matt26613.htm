<p><sup>6</sup> While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon 
the Leper, <sup>7</sup> a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very 
expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" 
they asked. <sup>9</sup> "This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the 
money given to the poor."</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this 
woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me. <sup>11</sup> The poor you will always 
have with you, but you will not always have me. <sup>12</sup> When she poured this 
perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. <sup>13</sup> I tell you the 
truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will 
also be told, in memory of her."</p>
