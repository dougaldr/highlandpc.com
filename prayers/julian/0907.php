<br>September 7

<p>Lord,</p>
<p>When You sent the twelve spies into the land of Canaan, 
ten of them decided that it would be too difficult for the children of Israel to 
conquer. Two of them, Joshua and Caleb, knew that they could indeed conquer the 
land but only with Your help which You promised. The children of Israel 
sided with the ten defeatists, turning away from Your Word and Your promises. As 
a result, the Israelites wandered around in the wilderness for one generation, 
forty years. The unbelievers died off, but Caleb and Joshua lived to inherit the 
land.</p>
<p>Although we cannot always see a clear distinction in this 
life between those who trust You and those who do not, You see that distinction 
with clarity. For to have faith in You is to affirm Your character as the God 
Who keeps His Word, as the God Who is trustworthy and has complete integrity. 
To doubt You is to attack Your very character. And so we glorify You when we 
trust You, even if we do not understand. Help my faith to be strong, O Lord.</p>
<p>Help me to resist temptation and the lures of the Satan 
today. Open my eyes to see how he is attacking my family, my church, my 
community and me.</p>
<p>Lord, marriage is something You ordained. It is not a 
man-made institution. Father, there are constant and relentless attacks waged 
against marriage and the evil one loves to break up families because this fits 
in so well with his agenda as &quot;the destroyer.&quot; Children of divorce are more 
likely to get divorced, more likely to take drugs, more likely to have 
psychological problems. O Father, help the traditional family to make a 
surprising comeback. Thwart the schemes of the devil, I ask.</p>
<p>O Lord, thank You for what you have done with the 1.6 
million people in the Indian State of Nagaland. Praise Your Name that the vast 
majority of the population claims to be firmly born-again believers! 
Hallelujah! Thank you for the churches, the theological institutions and the 
prosperity of this region. Yet, Lord, some Christians are not consistent in 
their behavior. Help the believers to be spiritually deep. May they send forth 
workers into other parts of India and win many to Christ, I ask.</p>
<p>Lord, bless the work of Global Recordings Network which 
&quot;seeks to effectively communicate the gospel of Jesus Christ through audio 
recordings to all peoples in their own language.&quot; They are committed to 
&quot;reach every tribe and tongue and nation with the gospel of Jesus Christ. GRN 
has made recordings in around 5,500 languages and dialects since the work began. 
Credible research indicates that there are over 10,000 vernacular languages 
spoken in the world today. Most of these don't have the written scriptures. GRN 
is committed to provide the good news for those tribes and tongues still without 
the gospel.&quot; Bless and prosper this ministry, I ask. Grant the ministry 
harmony and great fruit, I pray.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to look for opportunities to share the Gospel 
of Jesus Christ at home, at work, in school, or among those who rub shoulders 
with me on a regular basis. And then, Lord, bless my efforts.</p>
<p>I bring these requests before You, Father, in the Name of 
Yeshua, Amen.</p>
