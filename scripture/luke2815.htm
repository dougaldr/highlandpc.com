<p><sup>8</sup> And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,
keeping watch over their flocks at night.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> An angel of the Lord
appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were
terrified.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> But the angel said to them, &quot;Do not be afraid.&nbsp;
I
bring you good new of great joy that will be for all the people.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup>
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.&nbsp;
<sup>12</sup> This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths
and lying in a manger.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the
angel, praising God and saying,</p>

<p><sup>14</sup> &quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on
whom his favor rests.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>15</sup> When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the
shepherds said to one another, &quot;Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing
that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.&quot;</p>
