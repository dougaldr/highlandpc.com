<sup>9</sup> How can a young man keep his way pure?<br>
By living according to your word.
</p>

<p>
<sup>11</sup> I have hidden your word in my heart<br>
that I might not sin against you.
</p>

<p>
<sup>16</sup> I delight in your decrees;<br>
I will not neglect your word.
</p>

<p>
<sup>18</sup> Open my eyes that I may see<br>
wonderful things in your law.
</p>

<p>
<sup>45</sup> I will walk about in freedom,<br>
for I have sought out your precepts.
</p>

<p>
<sup>50</sup> My comfort in my suffering is this:<br>
Your promise preserves my life.
</p>

<p>
<sup>63</sup> I am a friend to all who fear you,<br>
to all who follow your precepts.<br>
<sup>64</sup> The earth is filled with your love, O L<span>ORD</span>;<br>
teach me your decrees.
</p>

<p>
<sup>92</sup> If your law had not been my delight,<br>
I would have perished in my affliction.
</p>

<p>
<sup>98</sup> Your commands make me wiser than my enemies,<br>
for they are ever with me.<br>
<sup>99</sup> I have more insight than all my teachers,<br>
for I meditate on your statutes.<br>
<sup>100</sup> I have more understanding than the elders,<br>
for I obey your precepts.
</p>

<p>
<sup>103</sup> How sweet are your words to my taste,<br>
sweeter than honey to my mouth!
</p>

<p>
<sup>105</sup> Your word is a lamp to my feet<br>
and a light for my path.
</p>

<p>
<sup>130</sup> The unfolding of your words gives light;<br>
it gives understanding to the simple.
