<p><sup>10</sup> By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert
builder, and someone else is building on it.&nbsp; But each one should be careful how
he builds.&nbsp; <sup>11 </sup>For no one can lay any foundation other than the one
already laid, which is Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup> If any man builds on this
foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, <sup>13</sup>
his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to&nbsp;
light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each
man's work.&nbsp; <sup>14</sup> If what he has built survives, he will receive his
reward.&nbsp; <sup>15</sup> If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will
be saved, but only as one escaping through flames.</p>
