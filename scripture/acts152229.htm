<p><sup>22</sup> Then the apostles and elders, with the whole 
church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with 
Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who 
were leaders among the brothers. <sup>23</sup> With them they 
sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the 
Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.
<sup>24</sup> We have heard that some went out from us without 
our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
<sup>25</sup> So we all agreed to choose some men and send them 
to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— <sup>26</sup> men 
who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<sup>27</sup> Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to 
confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. <sup>28</sup> It 
seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond 
the following requirements: <sup>29</sup> You are to abstain 
from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals 
and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell. </p>
