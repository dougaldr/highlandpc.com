<p>
<b>Matthew 13</b> presents us with the &quot;Parables of the Kingdom.&quot; In this section, it 
seems as though Jesus, having been rejected by the Jewish establishment in 
<b>Matthew 12</b>, is revealing the nature of the &quot;mystery&quot; form of His kingdom, what 
we would call the &quot;church age.&quot; The Old Testament set up (in theory) a 
&quot;theocracy,&quot; a government where God ruled through His Law (the Torah), mediated 
by priests and judges and later by kings. The Old Testament predicted a better 
era in which God Himself would reign through the Messiah. This period we call 
the &quot;Millennium&quot; because Revelation tells us it will be 1,000 years in duration.</p>
<p>But 
what about now? Since most Jews rejected Jesus and the Millennium did not come, 
where do Jesus' followers fit? The answer is &quot;within the mystery Kingdom of 
God.&quot; The term &quot;mystery&quot; does not mean mysterious, but refers to previously 
withheld information—an era about which God had been tightlipped. The parables 
of <b>Matthew 13</b> describe this era, but many first-century Jews could not 
understand this concept because of spiritual paradigm blindness.</p>
<p>The 
Parable of the Soils has some interesting parallels from within Judaism in the 
Talmud. These descriptions frequently divided disciples (learners) into four 
categories. Here is one such division. Those who are: 
<ol><li>Quick to learn and 
quick to lose, his gain is canceled by his loss. 
<li>Slow to learn and slow to 
lose, his loss is canceled by his gain. 
<li>Quick to learn and slow to lose, 
this is a good portion. 
<li>Slow to learn and quick to lose, this is an evil 
portion... (from Brad H. Young in <u>The Parables</u>).</ol>

In my under-standing 
of this parable, it is only the one who bears fruit, the one with the receptive 
heart (soil), who is the genuine believer. I understand the others to be lost.</p>
<p>The 
Parable of the Mustard Seed gives us an example of the figure of speech known as 
ellipsis, where a phrase from a previous sentence is understood in the latter. 
When Jesus tells us that many seeds are sown by a farmer and the mustard seed is 
the smallest seed, the expression, &quot;of seeds farmers sow,&quot; is understood from 
the previous sentence. Ellipsis is the key to sorting out many seemingly 
difficult passages. If I said, &quot;I ate steak for dinner&quot; and then said, &quot;I ate 
green beans and potatoes,&quot; the context tells my mind to insert &quot;during dinner.&quot; 
We use ellipsis everyday.</p>
<p>The 
Parable of the Wheat and Tares mentions a wheat-like grain (translated &quot;tares&quot;) 
that resembles wheat but is not wheat. Ann Punton tells us the grain referred 
to as &quot;tares&quot; is really darnel—&quot;Darnel is indistinguishable from wheat until 
both are ripe. Then, the heavier wheat heads bend while the lighter darnel 
remains upright. Just before harvest, workers go through the fields picking it 
out. It is poisonous and can make people very ill if any is left and gets 
ground into the flour...&quot; (<u>The World Jesus Knew</u>).</p>
