<p>Father,</p>
<p>When Joseph, who was engaged to Mary, found out that she 
was pregnant, it broke his heart. He was engaged to her and loved her; he could 
not understand how she could be unfaithful. She had probably tried to tell him 
of the angel's appearance, but who would believe such a thing? But, Lord, in 
Your grace, You gave Joseph a dream to confirm that Mary was indeed still a 
virgin. The angel explained that the baby would be named &quot;Jesus&quot; because, &quot;he 
will save his people from their sins&quot; (<b>Matthew 1:21</b>).</p>
<p>O Father, the Lord Jesus came to save us from hell and 
death and Your wrath, but he also came to save us from our sins! His 
own people, the Jewish nation, largely rejected him although some 
believed, thank You that &quot;as many as received Him, to them he gave the right 
to become the children of God&quot; (<b>John 1:12</b>).</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that for me and all who know Christ death 
has lost its sting. At death, my body and soul are separated. Although my soul 
will go to enjoy your presence, one day my resurrected body and soul will be 
reunited. </p>
<p>Father, I have learned that I cannot succeed in the 
Christian life by sheer willpower, trying harder, or working up enthusiasm. It 
takes the daily routine of prayer and Bible study plus being engaged in active 
ministry of some kind. But even more so, it takes Your Spirit's work within; 
otherwise what I do is forced and contrived. Create in me a willing heart. 
Please continue to work in me. Help me be faithful in the routine of life; keep 
me from going the way of making &quot;decision after decision,&quot; as though there were 
a quick fix for all my areas of weakness. Instead, give me a hunger for You.</p>
<p>I especially remember those who are seriously ill and have 
younger children. Lord, we all expect to die�unless delivered by rapture. But, 
Lord, children need their parents so badly. Please preserve their lives and 
their health, I ask.</p>
<p>Lord, strife within families is awful. Please bring 
together members of my family or of a family I know who are at odds with other 
family members. We ask that the offenders would embrace repentance, apology, 
restitution and taking responsibility. Help them to be reasonable and willing to 
establish credibility over time, if that is what is needed. And we pray that 
those offended would be gracious, yet not na�ve. We know some situations can 
never be fixed, but we pray that many relationships would be reconciled.</p>
<p>Today I remember the small countries included under the 
term Micronesia including the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall 
Islands, Northern Marianas and Palau. These small nations are affiliated with 
the U.S. in varying ways and there is a high percentage that professes to be 
born-again evangelical averaging over 20% per country. Yet many professing 
Christians still practice native superstitions and these nations are weak when 
it comes to sexual morality. Lord, raise up strong leaders from within the 
church and help the Christians there to take deep root and forsake their pagan 
heritage.</p>
<p>Use me to Your glory today and help me be a witness for 
You here, in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
