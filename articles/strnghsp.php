<br>Strenthening a Church Through Hospitality

<p>When Marylu and I first moved to Kokomo, we were the new kids on the block.&nbsp;
Some people slighted us because we were different. Others thought we were
on the stupid side because we did not know what they knew. It took effort
to &quot;break in&quot; to the church and community&#151;at least at first.&nbsp;
Fortunately, most folks treated us kindly, patiently, and considerately.&nbsp;
Some tried to put themselves in our shoes, and we appreciated that. But
note this point: if it was difficult for a pastor to break into a
community and a church, how difficult must it be for other newcomers to feel at
home?</p>
<p>The Bible is filled with admonitions for Christians to exercise
hospitality.&nbsp;
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/rom1213.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 12:13</a>
is clear: &quot;practice hospitality,&quot; we
are admonished. Although we tend to think of hospitality as making people
comfortable while visiting our homes, such a limited definition narrows our
minds and keeps us from seeing the bigger picture. Hospitality involves
doing our part to see that others feel welcome and at ease with their
surroundings. And hospitality is key to a church's effectiveness.</p>
<p>The nature of hospitality is meant to be variable. Often how we
offer hospitality is hinged upon our personality. On one occasion, I
remember giving strangers who were standing in line at Scoops ice cream parlor
advance information as to what flavors were featured that day. That's
because I am a schmoozer at heart and struggle with only a minimal number of
inhibitions. That's me. Not everyone is like me, nor should they be.</p>
<p>But every believer SHOULD be hospitable, and a great place to demonstrate
hospitality is at church, though we should also be hospitable at work and in the
neighborhood. Our greeting time is a wonderful opportunity to sharpen this
skill. True, greeting time serves several purposes: it provides an
ideal transition time for children to be dismissed to Children's Church, it
gives opportunity for folks to fellowship with one another, but it can also
become a key time to show hospitality to newcomers. If there are no
newcomers, you can be hospitable by hiking to a different part of the auditorium
and greeting someone you do not know. Greeting time can become a time to
share your enthusiasm with others.</p>
<p>Hospitality, at a church level, means taking ownership. See yourself as
responsible to guide strangers, to greet them, to initiate small talk, and, if
they return, to get to know them. If they have children or teens, you
might put a word in for Awana, BASIC, SOL, or Sunday School. You might
mention the Children's Choir. Let them know you are glad they are in
attendance and you'd love to see them come back. Muster a little
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Hospitality involves putting yourselves in their shoes. Even if they
never return, they are (for that little while) the &quot;new kids on the
block.&quot; It is your job to help remove the sense of isolation that
comes from unfamiliar surroundings and people.</p>
<p>As new people begin attending, get to know them. It is great to develop
close friendships within the body, and you should not attempt to make everyone
your close friend. But closeD friendships are a bummer. You can have
only a few close friends yet demonstrate an attitude of open friendship.&nbsp;
The difference between open friendship and closed friendship is this: the
willingness to socialize with others besides current friends. Whether you
add new faces to your circle of close friends or simply increase your circle of
general friends, hospitality demands you do not keep to yourself. Jesus
was unusually close to Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, but he had many other friends.&nbsp;
It is that attitude of openness that makes for deeper levels of hospitality.</p>
<p>Another simple way to practice hospitality is to leave parking spaces
available for visitors. If you are healthy and do not have children or
equipment to tote, consider parking at the City Tire or A.G. Edwards parking
lots on Sunday mornings. Or you might be on the lookout for visitors.&nbsp;
When folks visit our church, they generally cannot find the rest rooms (despite
an abundance of signs), nursery, or classrooms. Offer to direct them or
walk them to the location they seek. Initiate conversation AFTER church
with visitors. Do not escape church like rats from a sinking ship, diving
into the ocean! Schmooze around.</p>
<p>And how about an even greater form of hospitality&#8212;inviting friends and
relatives to church? One recent study suggests that 9 out of 10 unchurched
folks appreciate when a friend or relative invites them to church. They
may not come, but they are glad someone cared enough to welcome them.&nbsp;
Interestingly, studies show that on Easter of 1999, 12% of atheists and
agnostics were in church! If you invite folks to church, be aware that
some folks will not be able to find our parking lot the first time around
(encourage them to use the Law Office parking lot). About half can find
it, which is why we need the spaces mentioned above. Force them to face
the rude awakening that Highland Park Church is near downtown, not near Highland
Park! You could give them an HPC brochure that has a map on the back.
(Find them in the track rack in the foyer.) You might even offer to have
them follow you to church.</p>
<p>If our church is to make its mark for Jesus Christ, we have to bear down and
get serious about reaching our potential. Bearing down simply means taking
the Bible seriously and practically, including the command to &quot;practice
hospitality.&quot; Let's think and pray how we can improve, because the
room for improvement is the biggest room in the world!
