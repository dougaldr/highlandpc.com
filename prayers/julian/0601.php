<p>Gracious Lord,</p>
<p>You are a God of order. Confusion and chaos may result 
from Your judgment and wrath, but Your Word tells us that &quot;God is not a God of 
disorder but of peace&quot; (<b>1 Corinthians 14:33</b>). Indeed, the opposite of disorder 
seems to be peace. The fact that You are the God of Peace is connected to the 
fact that You are the God of order. We can have peace because everything is 
under Your control; You order all. Even the disorder around us is part of a 
greater ordering. Ultimately, You have a plan that is so infinitesimally 
organized that I cannot possibly see how the tiny bits of it work as part of the 
whole. But I cling to Your promise that &quot;all things work together for good.&quot;</p>
<p>Help me to be an orderly person but not an obsessed 
person. Keep me from being a Martha in the name of order, but keep me from 
being passive and oblivious like Nabal the fool. Help me to thrive in that 
middle ground of &quot;relatively ordered&quot; putting my priorities to love You and to 
love people above my love for order.</p>
<p>Today I remember the poor, especially those who are poor 
through no fault of their own. In many parts of the world, even menial work is 
unavailable. The sickly and downtrodden also have my sympathy. O Lord, 
minister to those who are living in the misery of constant sickness, infirmity, 
pain, or weakness. Help those who have been abused, the true victims in this 
world. Help them, Lord, to escape that victim mentality that handicaps a person 
for life.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to bear up under the trials, disappointments, 
fears and tribulations of life including: __________.</p>
<p>Let me remember that You are developing my faith and that 
You often use difficult times to make me stronger in You. Though I admit that I 
usually hate such trials, I do appreciate what You have done in my life through 
them. My choice is to go through them with You or without You. I will go 
through them either way. I choose to go through them hand-in-hand with You.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the people of Malaysia. Despite the 
pressures from Islam, the evangelical church is growing. Thank You that 4.1% of 
the population claim to be born-again evangelicals and I pray that this 
percentage would double over the next 5 years! Lord, the church itself is 
sending forth missionaries and I ask that Malaysia would eventually become a 
pillar of the Kingdom of God. You have worked in great ways in this land, O 
Lord, please keep working! May the government be friendly toward Christianity 
and stop its attempts to restrict the Gospel, I pray.</p>
<p>I remember in prayer some missionary families I know 
personally or some missionary families my church supports including: __________. Bless 
them with health, provide for their needs, bless their families, protect them 
and send angels to guard them and fill them with Your Holy Spirit that they 
might minister with Your power and direction. Give them a fruitful and useful 
ministry, whatever their particular task in the grand picture of world missions.</p>
<p>Help me to be a team player for You today, I ask in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
