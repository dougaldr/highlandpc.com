<p><sup>1</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> said to Moses, <sup>2</sup> 
&quot;Say to the Israelites: 'A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son 
will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her 
monthly period. <sup>3</sup> On the eighth day the boy is to be 
circumcised. <sup>4</sup> Then the woman must wait thirty-three 
days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go 
to the sanctuary until the days of her purification are over.
<sup>5</sup> If she gives birth to a daughter, for two weeks 
the woman will be unclean, as during her period. Then she must wait sixty-six 
days to be purified from her bleeding.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> &quot; 'When the days of her purification for a son 
or daughter are over, she is to bring to the priest at the entrance to the Tent 
of Meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a dove for 
a sin offering. <sup>7</sup> He shall offer them before the 
L<span>ORD</span> to make atonement for her, and then she will be ceremonially clean from her 
flow of blood. </p>
<p>&quot; 'These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a boy or a 
girl. <sup>8</sup> If she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring 
two doves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin 
offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be 
clean.' &quot; </p>
