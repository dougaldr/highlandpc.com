<p><sup>21</sup> So the L<span>ORD</span> God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and
while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place
with flesh. <sup>22</sup> Then the L<span>ORD</span> God made a woman from the rib he had
taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.<br>
<sup>23</sup> The man said,<br>
<br>
&quot;This is now bone of my bones<br>
and flesh of my flesh;<br>
she shall be called 'woman,'<br>
for she was taken out of man.&quot;<br>
<br>
<sup>24</sup> For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be
united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.</p>
