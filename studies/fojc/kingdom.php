<p>The term “The Kingdom of God” is either used or implied in each of the four 
incidents mentioned in today’s sermon. Jesus frequently used this term (or “The 
Kingdom of Heaven”) to refer to both broad and specific aspects of the Kingdom. 
There are <i>at least</i> 5 distinct uses of this term, as defined by Arnold 
Fruchtenbaum in his book, <u>Israelology: The Missing Link in Systematic 
Theology</u>:</p>
<ol><li><b>The Universal Kingdom or Eternal Kingdom.</b> 
Fruchtenbaum tells us that “...this emphasizes His eternal, sovereign rule 
everywhere over His entire creation.” Since God is the Sovereign of the 
universe, the universe is His Kingdom.
<li><b>The Spiritual Kingdom</b> 
refers to all those who have been born again. We can think of the words of 
Jesus to Nicodemus in <b>John 3</b>, “Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the 
Kingdom of God.” The Spiritual Kingdom predates the church (people were born 
again before Christ came), but during the church age the spiritual kingdom and 
the true church are one and the same (much like State Road 22 and State Road 35 
run together for a certain length), the Spiritual Kingdom being the broader 
term. In today’s lesson, Zaccheus is called a true “son of Abraham.” This 
meant that he was not only related to Abraham genetically, but also exemplified 
Abraham’s faith. A term used by Paul is “the Israel of God.” 
<li><b>The Theocratic Kingdom</b> 
refers to that era of Jewish history when God ruled through mediators, to the 
degree that the judges or kings administrated His will. This era began with the 
first judge, Moses, and ended ignobly with the last king, Zedekiah, during the 
Babylonian captivity.
<li><b>The Messianic Kingdom</b> 
refers to the Millennium, the 1,000 year reign of Christ on the earth. In a 
sense, it is a continuation of the Theocratic Kingdom with the perfect King, 
Jesus Christ Himself, reigning. Fruchtenbaum comments, “This was the kingdom 
proclaimed as being at hand by John the Baptist. This was the kingdom Jesus 
offered to the Jewish people. It is the kingdom that was rejected.” Although 
postponed, this Kingdom will one day be realized when our prayer, “Thy kingdom 
come” is granted 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/acts31921.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Acts 3:19-21</a>).
<li><b>The Mystery Kingdom</b> 
is described by Christ in <b>Matthew 13</b> in the form of parables. It is the form of 
Christ’s reign while He is absent, so it includes the church age and the 
Tribulation period. We currently experience this “mystery kingdom” which has 
lasted nearly 2,000 years thus far.</ol>
<p>Another way to look at matters is to combine #4 and #5 and refer to the 
“Messianic Age” as having begun with the birth of Christ, and then dividing into 
three phases: the Church Age, the Tribulation, and the Millennium. Thus the 
birth of Christ began an era called “the last days” as opposed to the “former 
days” before Christ. The term “last days” may also refer to the period just 
before the Tribulation or the Tribulation itself. When we get to heaven, we can 
ask God why He chose such confusing terminology!</p>
