<p><sup>37</sup> On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said
in a loud voice.&nbsp; &quot;If any one is thirsty let him come to me and drink.&nbsp;
<sup>38</sup>
Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will
flow from within him.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>39</sup> By this he meant the Spirit, whom
those who believed in him were later to receive.&nbsp; Up to that time the Spirit had
not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</p>
