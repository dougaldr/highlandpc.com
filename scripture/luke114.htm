<p><sup>1</sup> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things
that have been fulfilled among us, <sup>2</sup> just as they were handed down 
to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
<sup>3</sup> Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything 
from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for 
you, most excellent Theophilus, <sup>4</sup> so that you may know the certainty 
of the things you have been taught.</p>
