<br>Confession and Cleansing
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Pure and Holy Creator of all, I address you as my heavenly Father. I thank
you that as a father pities his son, so you pity those who fear you. I approach
your holy throne with sin-stained hands, needing your cleansing and forgiveness.</p>
<p>I have sinned by________________. I take full responsibility for my sin; I
cannot excuse it and will not justify it. Thank you for the promise that if we
confess our sins, you are faithful and just to forgive us our sins.</p>
<p>I praise you for sending Jesus Christ to be my advocate. His blood shows the
debt was paid, and his intercession on my behalf opens the way of fellowship
with you whenever that way is closed by my sin. All I need do is confess and
turn, and he takes my cause upon himself.</p>
<p>I also praise you that if I am walking in the light as he is in the light,
and I sin unknowingly, his blood cleanses me. In the ignorance of many of my
sins, I confess an ignorance to the constant work of the Savior in keeping my
fellowship strong and direct with you, Father. When Satan seeks to rise up
against me with a charge of guilt, thank you that the Savior rises to my
defense. Thank you that he never loses a case, that the Christ always emerges a
victor.</p>
<p>Indeed, all of this reminds me that your ways are above my ways. Your
thoughts are lofty and high, my best thoughts are simple before you. I am
grateful that I do not need to fully grasp how you save me and keep me, but
rather can only grasp what has been revealed. Surely the secret things belong to
you, and I praise you that in your divine wisdom you have ordained it so. I
believe that you are truly all wise.</p>
<p>Like David of old, I, too, pray, &quot;Renew a steadfast spirit within me.&nbsp;
Create in me a clean heart, O Lord.&quot; May my frequent cleansings from sin
make me more appreciative of your grace. May I never confess to you
meaninglessly but with brokenness. Thank you that you can use sinful human
beings, especially those who are broken and humbled. Thank you that you cleanse
us so we can relate to you on the basis of a clear conscience.</p>
<p>Father, not only do I need renewal, I need to be strengthened in the inner
man. Yahweh, the great I AM, may I walk with you more closely this year than
last, indeed than any year before. May I grow little by little each day, and may
my growth be firm. Keep me from needing to backtrack to regain lost ground.</p>
<p>Teach me more about your Holy Spirit, the third divine person. May he fill me
each moment. As I have been cleansed from sin, I open every room in my heart to
him. May he clean out the defilement within me, convict me of my reservation in
serving and loving you, and may he produce his sweet and pure fruit within me.&nbsp;
Help me make the soil fertile by disciplining myself to follow you. Keep me in
the Word, in fellowship with you and your people. I pray, in the name of the
Messiah, Jesus. Amen.</p>
