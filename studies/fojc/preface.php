<p>I prayerfully determined to preach the &quot;series 
of a lifetime,&quot; taking over two years to preach through the life of Christ, 
combining material from all four Gospels. Logic dictates that every follower of 
Christ needs to understand the person, life, and the teachings of Jesus. Yet 
most Christians are never exposed to a <u>thorough</u> study 
of the life and teachings of Jesus, the Christ.
<br>
<br>
I had preached through Luke, the longest Gospel in terms of words or verses, 
twice before (taking a year and a half each time) and most of John in separated 
segments. I have taught all the Gospels, in survey fashion, on several 
occasions. <br>
<br>
This time around, I focused my research on the Jewish background and roots of 
the Gospels. I studied material from Messianic Jewish sources, mainstream Jewish 
sources, and scholarly materials from mainstream, conservative evangelical 
sources. Many of these addressed the cultural and religious backgrounds of the 
first century. Others addressed figures of speech unique to the period within 
Judaism. <br>
<br>
In the process, I decided to include a handout sheet for each sermon for our 
church folks to collect. A few of them were 
fill-in-the-blank sermon outlines, which I have chosen not to include. Of the 
remainder, the majority contained relevant information that related to the 
sermon-lesson. Some reinforced and documented material mentioned in the sermon; 
other material was supplemental (items I did not want to address during my 
sermon, but relevant to the text). A few pages, such as those addressing the 
Sermon on the Mount, actually break new ground. <br>
<br>
Since some of this information is hard to come by, I thought I would share this 
with other students of Scripture. The bibliography will guide readers to find 
unique materials that help unlock some unclear passages in the Gospels. Some of 
these books are reviewed on

Although he is not quoted, I would especially 
like to thank my &quot;Synoptic Gospels&quot; professor at Moody Bible Institute, Dr. Paul 
Benware, who, in 1979, aimed me in the right direction and whose insights I 
still cherish. <br>
<br>
Since brevity was crucial (all handouts were limited to one page), and since I 
was writing this material at quite a clip, my style may seem a bit unpolished. 
Perhaps I will take the time to rework some of this material in the future. <br>

God bless you as you seriously seek to not only 
know the Savior in a saving way, but also to know <u>about</u> Him and the real 
meaning of what He taught.
