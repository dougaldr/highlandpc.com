<p><sup>1</sup> After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John 
the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. 
<sup>2</sup> There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like 
the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. 
<sup>3</sup> Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, 
talking with Jesus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be 
here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for 
Moses and one for Elijah."</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> While he was still speaking, a bright cloud 
enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I 
love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown 
to the ground, terrified. 
<sup>7</sup> But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't 
be afraid." 
<sup>8</sup> When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.

 </p>
<p><sup>9</sup> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed 
them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has 
been raised from the dead." </p>
