<p><sup>51</sup> Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we
will all be changed&#151; <sup>52</sup> in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at
the last trumpet.&nbsp; For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised
imperishable, and we will be changed.&nbsp; <sup>53</sup> For the perishable must
clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with the immortality.&nbsp; <sup>54</sup>
When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with
immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: &quot;Death has
been swallowed up in victory.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>55</sup> Where, O death, is your victory?&nbsp; Where, O death, is your
sting?&quot;</p>

<p><sup>56</sup> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.&nbsp;
<sup>57</sup>
But thanks be to God!&nbsp; He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus&nbsp;
Christ.</p>

<p><sup>58</sup> Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm.&nbsp; Let nothing move you.&nbsp;
Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your
labor in the Lord is not in vain.</p>
