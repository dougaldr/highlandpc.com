<p><sup>11</sup> One day, after Moses had grown up, 
he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. 
He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
<sup>12</sup> Glancing this way and that and 
seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
<sup>13</sup> The next day he went out and saw 
two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, &quot;Why are you hitting your 
fellow Hebrew?&quot; 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>14</sup> The man said, &quot;Who made you 
ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the 
Egyptian?&quot; Then Moses was afraid and thought, &quot;What I did must have become 
known.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> When Pharaoh heard of this, he 
tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, 
where he sat down by a well.</p>
