<p><sup>18</sup> Then the Jews demanded of him, “What 
miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” </p>
<p><sup>19</sup> Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, 
and I will raise it again in three days.” </p>
<p><sup>20</sup> The Jews replied, “It has taken forty-six 
years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?”
<sup>21</sup> But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
<sup>22</sup> After he was raised from the dead, his disciples 
recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that 
Jesus had spoken. </p>
