<br>Sunday School or "Is There Life Before the 10:30 Service?"
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>While some Highland Park Church people are digging into a grapefruit and
squirting one another at the breakfast table, scores of other HPC folks are
already at church digging into God's Word. No, I am not talking about our
Express Service at 8:30&#151;that's too early for most&#151;but our Sunday School at
9:30 a.m.</p>

<p>
Sunday School offers opportunities for all age levels to learn God's Word.&nbsp;
Harry Husted, our Superintendent, works with teachers to provide quality
curriculum and well-staffed classes. But some of you may not realize that
Sunday School is a great activity for adults. Sunday School can be an
important part of Christian discipleship and growth.</p>

<p>
Statistically, 68% of the formerly unchurched and 58% of folks who transfer
from one church to another attend Sunday School. Sunday School is by far
the most effective small group ministry. Statistics show that of new
Christians who regularly attend Sunday School, 83% will continue to be
active in that same church five years later. In contrast, only 16% of new
Christians who attend the morning service (but not Sunday School) are likely
to be involved in that same church five years later. (These statistics,
which apply to evangelical churches only, can be found in the book, <u>
Surprising Insights from the Unchurched</u> by Thom S. Rainer, Zondervan, 2001,
p. 118). Put another way, the number of adults attending Sunday School is
the best measurement as to the permanency of church growth.</p>

<p>
Why are the statistics so lop-sided? No one knows for sure, but the answer
seems obvious to me: as people feed on the Word of God, they become
spiritually enriched and experience the satisfaction emanating from God's
Word; others try to fill that void through church hopping and varied
religious experiences. The fellowship of others seeking the Word of God
may
not be as varied as other forms of fellowship, but the camaraderie of fellow
Bible students is good for the soul.</p>

<p>
Let me encourage you to become part of our Sunday School crowd. We offer
two adult classes. The parlor class is taught by Chuck Freyler and Jim
Evans and follows the International Sunday School schedule. The class in
the basement is taught by Pastor Ed and follows a curriculum that takes
class participants through the entire Bible over a seven-year period (though
the class occasionally takes a quarter off for topical studies).</p>

<p>
So why not let that grapefruit squirt you a little earlier Sunday morning?&nbsp;
Drink an extra cup of coffee and then pack up the family for Sunday School.&nbsp;
It might be that missing something in your spiritual walk. And if you have
children, well, nothing quite replaces Sunday School! We have plenty of
room for you.</p>
