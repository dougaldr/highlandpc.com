<br>The Pride Battle
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>The subject of pride and its counterpart, humility, is a
complex one indeed. My plan for today&#39;s column is to share a few thoughts about
a subject that could take volumes to expound. Although I am not addressing
pride systematically, perhaps you might find a few of my meandering thoughts
helpful.<p>It can be tough to define pride. In its negative
sense, we can list synonyms like &quot;arrogance,&quot; &quot;smugness,&quot; &quot;conceit,&quot; or
&quot;self-importance.&quot; But any thesaurus will suggest some positive meanings for
our English word &quot;pride,&quot; including &quot;satisfaction (from a job well done)&quot; and
&quot;self-esteem.&quot;<p>Most of us probably agree that it is good to
savor a job well done (or, at least, a job we think we have done well). I&#39;ll
admit to being a person who enjoys savoring. When I paint a room and return its
items to their proper places, I look over and savor my work. Some of you say,
&#34;On to the next room.&#34; I love you anyway.<p>And most of us will
agree that a reality-based self-esteem is a good thing. If you can sing well,
then admit it. If you are good at basketball, don&#39;t lie to yourself about it.<p>
But when it comes to the first type of pride (arrogance, smugness, conceit,
self-importance), well, we are clearly into the heart of sin central! Of
course, not everyone sees it that way. Just as many stubborn people believe
deep down that their stubbornness is a virtue, so many agree with Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle&#39;s Sherlock Holmes who said, &quot;I disagree with those who list humility
among the virtues.&quot; Millions of people believe that this sort of pride is a
virtue. Some, like Sherlock Holmes, are unashamedly proud, while the majority
savor their pride more discreetly.<p>But what is so bad about
pride anyhow? Why does the Bible constantly warn of the dangers of pride and
extol the virtues of humility? I could offer many suggestions, but I want to
keep this simple and brief. Pride is contrary to the two great commandments, to
love God and our neighbor. The curious among you asks, &quot;How so?&quot; (I love it
how you ask those questions just when I want you to! Makes me feel proud.)&nbsp;
Pride gets in the way of our relationship with God because God is the one who
always deserves all the credit.&nbsp; When we think we are hot stuff, we lessen what
we think of God.<p>Although I could fill up the <i>Body Builder</i>
with verses, this one should make the point: <b>Isaiah 2:17</b>, &quot;The arrogance of man
will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> alone will be exalted
in that day&#8230;&quot;<p>In order to deal with God, we must acknowledge
our helplessness and dependence upon Him. This is especially true regarding
salvation. God saves us in such a way that we can take absolutely NO CREDIT,
but all the glory... not 99%, but all... goes to Him. Here are a few more
verses:<p><b>Ephesians 2:8-10</b>, &quot;For it is by grace you have been
saved, through faith&#8212;and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&#8212;not by
works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in
Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.&quot;<p>
When Paul writes, &quot;it&quot; is the gift of God, he is referring to salvation in its
totality, grace, the faith we exercise, the works that follow salvation&#8212;they are
all part of a gift God gives to those who will receive it. Unfortunately, pride
keeps people from recognizing their own helplessness and bankruptcy before God.&nbsp;
The first century unbelieving Jews were a case in point. Paul writes in <b>Romans
10:3</b>: &quot;Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought
to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.&quot; Millions
today are in the same category. They fail to realize that Jesus is the Savior,
not 85% Savior while we are the other 15%.<p>Paul reinforces
this in <b>Romans 9:16</b>: &quot;It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort,
but on God's mercy.&quot; The same principle is true in the realm of spiritual
growth. Note what Paul writes in <b>Philippians 2:13</b>: &quot;&#8230;for it is God who works in
you to will and to act according to his good purpose.&quot;<p>What
this means is that God predisposes His true children to have an appetite to grow
in Him and serve Him. I sometimes wonder if we are trying to get lost people to
act like Christians against their wills. I sometimes fear the possibility that
some professing believers do not really possess salvation. Ultimately it comes
down to this, &quot;the Lord knows them that are His&quot; (<b>1 Timothy 2:19</b>).<p>
But in the life of the genuine believer, God is working to create desires in us
for Him. We can nurture those or submit to them, but they do not merely come
from our own wills. God is working in us. When we humble ourselves and realize
what He is doing, it gets mighty tough to hog the credit!<p>But
pride also keeps us from loving others. Although we may not think of it, the
status game is not a game of compassion for others. If we invest our entire
supply of emotional energy by pursuing wealth, prestige, recognition, or
climbing any ladder (even the &quot;let me impress you with my holiness&quot; ladder), we
are slighting others in the process.<p>If I live my life in
competition with others, I am seeking to exalt myself above them. If I am out
to impress, I am also suppressing others. Spiritual realities should be our
priority (&quot;seek ye first the kingdom of God&quot;) and take precedence over the quest
for career success, education, status, wealth, dexterity, or expertise. It is
great for Christians to try to excel at whatever they do, and it is fine to
enjoy life&#39;s legitimate pleasures in a balanced way&#8212;when all of these are truly
aligned under the Lordship of Christ.<p>Jesus put it bluntly in
<b>Matthew 6:24</b>, &quot;No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and
love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You
cannot serve both God and money.&#34; This is true in relationship to others as
well.<p>Since pride blocks our relationship to God and hinders
our ability to love others, it is nasty stuff.&nbsp;
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/is141215.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Isaiah 14</a>
tells us that pride transformed the brilliant and pure angel Lucifer into the dark and evil
fallen angel renamed Satan, the adversary. Odds are that pride has repeated
this ugly trick in varying degrees in your life.<p>&quot;Humble
yourself,&quot; the Scriptures urge us time and time again. Reflect often upon the
nature of God&#39;s grace and your bankruptcy without Him. Limit pride or your
pride will limit you.
