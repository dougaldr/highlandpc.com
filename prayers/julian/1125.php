<p>Ever-present Lord,</p>
<p>You are the God Who delivered Daniel from the lions' den. 
You worked a miracle and closed the mouths of those hungry lions. Yet on the 
other hand, lions in the Roman Coliseum killed many faithful Christians. You are 
the God Who can deliver, but You do not always choose to do so 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/heb113238.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Hebrews 11:32-38</a>). 
And so, Lord, we trust You and Your power, but we also 
acknowledge that Your ways are higher than ours, for we cannot reduce You down 
to a formula. And we ask, not command; we request, not demand; we can plead our 
case, but we do not always understand Your long-term purpose.</p>
<p>Father, I pray for those believers who are in the military, 
or whose family or friends are serving. O Lord, protect them and bring lasting 
peace and freedom to our world, I pray.</p>
<p>Precious Lord, many couples struggle with their marriages. 
Lord, help struggling couples to endure, to address problems as they arise and 
to humble themselves before You. Help wives to accept the nature of men and men 
the nature of their wives. Help individuals to repent of the sins that create 
problems and help each one to face his or her own sin, reminding each one that 
they cannot change their spouses, only themselves. </p>
<p>Father, I intercede for believers who are struggling with 
substance abuse, addictions, or other bad or undesirable habits. Some practices 
are wrong, even in moderation. Others are wrong in excess. Others are wrong only 
because they become enslaving. Help us all to put off our bad ways and replace 
them with positively constructive ways. Rather than steal, let us labor to give 
to those in need. Rather than gossip, let us praise. Instead of being drunk with 
wine, help us to be filled with Your Spirit. Help us replace the undesirable 
with the good or at least the neutral.</p>
<p>My God, I pray for the Yunnan Province of China with its 42 
million people. Lord, in some communities the Gospel has been well received. 
Among some of the people groups in the area, there is hardly a Christian to be 
found. All in all, well over 3% of the population would claim to be born-again 
and evangelical. Lord, work among all the people groups there, I pray, 
especially the Han Chinese. Speed Bible translation into the indigenous 
languages of the various people. Thank you that 22 projects are underway. 
Lord, may the number of believers double over this next decade, I pray.</p>
<p>Heavenly King, bless Asian Outreach International, &quot;an 
alliance of interdependent Christian ministries worldwide. The Alliance is bound 
together by a common faith in Christ and commitment to the ministry of the 
Gospel to Asians.
[Their] mission is carried out by committed Christians from both Asian and 
non-Asian countries who serve together and use every means possible to proclaim 
Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord to Asian people everywhere.&quot; Father, keep them 
true to You. Protect them, provide for them, empower them by Your Spirit and 
give them great wisdom and much fruit. May they work in harmony with one another 
and with You, I ask.</p>
<p>Help me live in harmony with Your will for me today, I 
request in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
