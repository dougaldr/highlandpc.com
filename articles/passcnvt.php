<br>Passion or Conviction? God's Real Presence of Group Psychology?
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>If you know Ed Vasicek, you know that I am not too impressed by many of the
trends in our broader American evangelical movement. Some trends have been
positive, but many have not. The positive trends include a whole arsenal of
teaching tools and technological advances. We can help people
&quot;see&quot; the
mission field through videotape; we can be better organized and work more
efficiently by using computers; we can quickly and more frequently
communicate with missionaries by email.
</p>

<p>Negative
trends are sometimes the result of the collapse of our
social structure and our inability to relate well in marriage, family, and
society. Since our emotional and social longings are being unfulfilled due
to our personal disappointments and failures, we seek to satisfy these
desires in alternative ways. Many look to the church to provide what
should
be obtained elsewhere. Churches that offer such substitutes may experience
staggering growth, but one wonders how healthy this growth is. It is what
many people want, but is it what they need? Let's look at some of these
trends, trends that are pinch-hitting for the real sluggers of solid
relationships.
</p>

<p>The first
trend is the &quot;passion&quot; trend, one of evangelicalism's
new buzzwords. For centuries, the word &quot;passion&quot; had negative
connotations. Passion was often seen as the cause of problems, anywhere from adultery to
financial irresponsibility. The modern trend describes passion no longer
as
a vice, but as a virtue. We now speak of &quot;passion for the Lord.&quot;
</p>

<p>Having a
&quot;passion&quot; for the Lord is not bad if by passion we mean
&quot;zeal,&quot; &quot;life,&quot; and &quot;dedication.&quot; The Bible
nowhere speaks of &quot;passion&quot; for
God, but it does address the need for zeal. Zeal (eagerness to serve) is
measured not in depth of feeling but in its fruit, good works. <a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph210.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Ephesians 2:10</a>
 tells us that God saved us and this salvation is evidenced by our good
works. In <b> Revelation 2:5</b> the scolding Christ instructs the lukewarm
Ephesian believers to remedy their situation&#151;&quot;Repent and do the things
you
did at first.&quot; <b>Titus 2:14</b> tells us that God saved us to make us His
holy
people, &quot;...eager to do what is good.&quot; This zeal is to spring
from within,
as the Holy Spirit provides us with a constant flow of zeal
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john737ff.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 7:37ff</a>).
</p>

<p>Some modern
Christians use the word &quot;passion&quot; to refer to an
adrenaline-like feeling that does not necessarily show itself in works. This is in contrast to Biblical zeal, which is tied to a track record of
works. Even faith, though intensely felt, is meaningless if it does not
produce action, works, or good deeds (the theme of the Book of James). James' argument still stands, &quot;Show me your faith without deeds, and I will
show you my faith by what I do.&quot; Rather than passion, I prefer the
word
&quot;zeal&quot; and the term &quot;conviction&quot; because, in my mind,
passion can be a wave
of enthusiasm that easily fades. Convictions are what people die for.&nbsp;
There is a resolve in conviction that endures.
</p>

<p>Another trend
I have noted is this &quot;Presence of God&quot; thing. This IS a Biblical term, but, in my opinion, the meaning has changed from
the Scriptural or traditional norm.&nbsp;<b> Matthew 18:20</b> describes the simplicity
of what it means to be in God's presence in a New Testament sense:&nbsp;
&quot;For
where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them.&quot;
</p>

<p>The topic of
God's presence is multifaceted, especially when the
entire Bible is taken into account. God IS everywhere; He is omnipresent.&nbsp;
But there is a sense in which He is especially located on the throne in
heaven (we call this the &quot;localized presence of God&quot;). In Old
Testament
times, He uniquely dwelt above the Ark of the Covenant in the form of a
pillar of cloud. The New Testament concept of the presence of God is not
complex: when two or more believers gather in the name of Jesus, He is
especially present. We do not need to work up the presence of God by
getting into some religious frenzy. We either believe He is especially
present or we do not, it's that simple. And this is the difference between
the Biblical (and traditional) understanding of God's presence and its
trendy counterpart.
</p>

<p>A third trend
is actually a return to an older belief that a
church building is &quot;The House of God.&quot; Biblically, the only
permanent
structure God ever commanded to have constructed was the Temple in Jerusalem
on Mt. Zion. Modern church buildings are gathering places for God's
people;
they are neither shrines nor dwelling places for God's special presence as
the Tabernacle or Temple were. If church structures are sacred at all,
they
are sacred because of what takes place when the Body of Christ meets; only
in that sense are they &quot;set apart.&quot; For the first few centuries
of the
Church, believers met in homes, alongside waterfronts, or even in
underground catacombs.
</p>

<p>Do not
misunderstand me. I believe church buildings are VERY
useful. I do not know that anyone loves our facility more than I do.&nbsp;
But
my point is this: God is no more present in the midst of a church
gathering
in a church building than He would be if we were in a gymnasium. What does
change between the two is the psychological atmosphere. Unfortunately, few
Christians understand the difference between body chemistry (altered by
psychology or environment) and the workings of the Holy Spirit. The
psychological should not be ignored, but it should be labeled
&quot;psychological&quot; and not &quot;spiritual.&quot; For example, our
church auditorium has
been improved greatly and the psychological difference jumps out at us. Because the atmosphere is different (e.g., praise banners, gentler
carpeting, etc.), it may be easier to focus upon the spiritual, but the
atmosphere is NOT spiritual; our focus on Christ is the spiritual element.
</p>

<p>Let me
illustrate these last two trends together. When a group
of believers gather in Jesus' name, His special presence is there, whether
felt or not. When religious unbelievers gather in a beautiful sanctuary
and
listen to awesome music, Jesus is NOT present in that same way, though it
may feel as though He were. See my point.
</p>

<p>Because so
many folks experience a lack of satisfaction in their
marriages, family, and society, and because more and more people are loners,
many are expecting the church to compensate for their relational and social
deficiencies. And some congregations offer to do just that; I question
this.
</p>

<p>May I make a
suggestion? If you are not passionate with your
spouse, do not attempt to satisfy your romantic craving by projecting it
toward God. Work on your marriage; do not use God as a substitute.&nbsp;
God is
personal and does want a relationship with you, but I believe it improper to
relate to Him as a romantic lover. Although the church is pictured as the
Bride of Christ, that illustration does not mean our love is romantic. Christ also spoke about wanting to gather His chicks under His wings like a
mother hen. If we are to have a romantic love for God based on the fact
that we are the bride of Christ, then we should also develop a chicken-like
relationship with Him since we are His brood!
</p>

<p>The downside
to all these trends is obvious: if we relate to God
in inappropriate ways, we no longer relate to Him in appropriate ways. And
we join a trendy, shallow form of Christianity: a belief system that forgets
who God really is, a system that redefines the terms away from their
Biblical meaning and thus is less than true. Instead, let us choose to
know
Yahweh our Lord through His Word, prayer, fellowship, His Spirit, and
sharing daily life with Him. Let's relate to Him as God, putting Him
first,
accepting our status as servants. We exist for Him; He does not exist for
us, though He does value our friendship. Let's remember that God is God.
