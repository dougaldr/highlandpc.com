<p>Father,</p>
<p>You are the God of Hope. You enjoy it when Your 
children hope in You, for this glorifies You. The contrast between us is 
striking: we are weak, You are strong. We cannot and You can. You are in 
control and we are often victims or observers. So when we hope in You, we 
worship and glorify You. You are truly the God of Hope.</p>
<p>Lord, I know that it is more important to fear You than to 
fear man. I know that You alone are worthy of worship. Yet keep me from going 
to the other extreme: holding mankind in contempt. Although we humans are 
rebels against You by nature, we are also in Your image. Even though that image 
has been marred by sin, it still survives in its less than perfect state. It is 
a privilege to be human, to enjoy life, to be creative and an active 
participator in the good things of society. Thank You, Lord, for making me a 
human being!</p>
<p>Lord, in addition I am thankful for many things two of 
which are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I pour out myself before You and ask Your Spirit to fill me. I surrender 
myself afresh to You today. Create in me a clean heart, and give me a hunger 
for the Word of God. May it ever be on my mind and in my heart.</p>
<p>Lord of the Harvest, I pray for the nation of Morocco. 
Father, sharing the Gospel here has been tough. The percentage of evangelical 
believers is so small that it is rated at 0%. There are perhaps 500 believers 
in a nation of over 28 million. The Islamic religion has long ago obliterated 
Christian witness, missionaries are not allowed and there is no official 
recognition of the church in this nation. Lord, multiply the church in Morocco 
exponentially. Use the Jesus film, satellite TV, radio and Bible recordings to 
get the word out. Help those who do believe to grow in maturity and to multiply 
themselves. O, Father, may there be 50,000 believers within 10 years. Send the 
mighty power of the Holy Spirit to draw these people to Yourself like a magnet 
draws iron particles, I pray.</p>
<p>Thank You Lord for Bible Basics International and their 
&quot;50 missionaries and volunteers and a wonderful outreach for the Gospel through 
radio, literature, evangelism and training ministries, and church planting.&quot; 
Thank You that &quot;Bible Basics produces a variety of radio programs which teach 
basic Bible truths. Our Bible Basics series of 52 programs on basic 
doctrine has been translated into more than 25 different languages from Assamese 
to Zulu. [Our] Spanish programs air on more than 100 radio stations throughout 
the Americas.&quot; Father, bless this outreach and discipleship ministry; provide 
for them, grant them harmony with one another, empower them by Your Spirit and 
direct their decisions, I ask.</p>
<p>I remember those who work as automotive glass installers 
and repairers and ask that they would do their job with pride. May many come 
to know You and may those who do freely share their testimony, I ask in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
