<p><sup>8</sup> Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not
indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> They must
keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup>
They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them
serve as deacons.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> In the same way, their wives are to be women worthy of respect,
not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage
his children and his household well.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> Those who have served well
gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
