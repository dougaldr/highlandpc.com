<p><sup>11</sup> And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, 
and this life is in his Son. <sup>12</sup> He who has the Son has life; 
he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup> I write these things to you who believe in the name of the 
Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.</p>
