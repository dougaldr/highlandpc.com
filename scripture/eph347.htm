<p><sup>4</sup> In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight
into the mystery of Christ, <sup>5</sup> which was not made known to men in
other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy
apostles and prophets.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> This mystery is that through the gospel the
Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and
sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace
given me through the working of his power.</p>
