<p>Our Father,</p>
<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and hello to the new, it 
is with optimism and hope. We thank You that we are not on probation, but we are 
accepted in Jesus Christ. We have a righteousness that is not our own, but a 
righteousness permanently given to us, the righteousness of Christ. You see us 
in Jesus. So we will begin this year secure in You, and we will end it secure in 
You.</p>
<p>Yet, apart from Your steadfast love and faithfulness to us, 
the year ahead is a mystery to us. Some of us will finish the year in glory. 
James tells us to remember that we cannot be sure of what tomorrow holds, so we 
learn to say, &quot;Lord willing&quot; about our plans, dreams, and intended actions.</p>
<p>Surprises both good and bad await us. Yet You, O Sovereign 
Lord, all-knowing One, are never surprised. We are vulnerable and very mortal; 
You are beyond and above all and immortal. We are dependent upon you for every 
breath we take; You existed before we were born with no difficulty whatsoever. 
We need You, but You do not need us. Yet You love us, cherish us, and consider 
us of such worth that You sent Your Son, Jesus, to atone for our sins. His 
resurrection from the dead assures us that His atoning work was complete; he now 
sits at Your right hand. </p>
<p>So, Lord, we ask You to work in us this next year, so that 
we might will and do your good pleasure. Help us to grow in the grace and 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Give us a hunger for Your Word, as newborn 
babes desire milk, that we may grow by it. Transform our lives as we renew our 
minds. Guide us in our choices, and help prayer to be second nature to us. 
Help us to share the good news of Jesus Christ with those around us; open doors 
and help us be alert to those open doors.</p>
<p>Send angels to watch our loved ones and us. Prosper us in 
all ways. Provide for us, help us enjoy good health, safety, and most of all 
help us exercise the faith You have given us to advance Your kingdom. Keep us 
from harm and evil, bind Satan, and help us to walk in the Spirit that we do not 
gratify the desires of the flesh. Help us to enjoy the wholesome things of this 
life, to live in a balanced way, and to be characterized by the fruit of Your 
Spirit. Help us love You and help us love others. Help us to practice love and 
godliness at home. May Your joy be our strength.</p>
<p>Bless our families, our church, our community, and our 
nation. End war, may all people enjoy freedom to worship Jesus Christ. Bless 
those who go into all the world and preach the Gospel. Prosper and bless all 
true missionaries, evangelists, and ministers of the Gospel.</p>
<p>So, Lord, we ask you to help us be good and faithful 
servants in 2013. We commit the coming year to you, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
