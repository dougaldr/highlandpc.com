<br>A Prayer in Times of Spiritual Warfare
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Dear God,</p>
<p>Thank You for saving me and washing me in the blood of 
Jesus Christ. I am Yours. You have bought me with that precious price.</p>
<p>Because I am Yours, not only do I have responsibilities 
toward You, but You, O Lord, have taken upon Yourself to include me in Your 
household and Your family. Since I am Your servant, Your child, and a joint-heir 
with Jesus Christ, it is in Your interest and to Your glory to help me gain 
victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil. You want to help me. You are 
predisposed toward me; Your grace flows freely in my direction.</p>
<p>Lord, Your adversary is my adversary. The evil one and his 
hoards have many, many schemes. More often than not, I am unaware of them. 
Protect me, O Lord, from the evil one. Put a hedge around me, a fence of Your 
protection. Send angels to guard me and my loved ones.</p>
<p>Lord, sometimes those fallen angels - those demons – 
appear as ghosts or aliens. They do not come from another planet, nor are they 
the spirits of departed people, though they often imitate the mannerisms of 
those people. And the evil one and his demons are involved in the occult as a 
whole: I repudiate all their workings. I freely align myself with You and 
against them. They are deceivers, desperate to distract people from You, Your 
ways, and Your mercies.</p>
<p>Lord, as Your child, I claim the precious blood of Jesus 
Christ. He died as my sacrifice for sin; He was buried, and the ashes of my sin 
debt, which had been paid in full at Calvary, were left in the ground. He rose 
the third day, victor over death, hell, and the devil. He ascended into heaven, 
where He sits at the right hand of the Father. In Christ, I am seated with Him, 
far above all principalities and powers.</p>
<p>I have no standing on my own.  I have no authority over Satan in myself.  
But because I am in Christ, He shares His power and authority with me.  I am 
dressed in His righteousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, O Lord, I pray Your protection from the evil 
one. I pray that You would bind or remove the evil spirits troubling me or my 
loved ones. I claim the blood of Christ and the word of my testimony.</p>
<p>So, Father, rebuke these spirits and remove their influence 
from my life and those whom I love. Do with them as You will, O Lord.</p>
<p>Thank You for hearing me and giving me the victory! In Jesus’ Name, I 
approach you, Amen.</p>
