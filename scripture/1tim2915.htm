<p><sup>9</sup> I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, 
not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes, 
<sup>10</sup> but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup>
I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be
silent.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> For Adam was formed first, then Eve.&nbsp; <sup>14</sup> And
Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a
sinner.&nbsp; <sup>15</sup> But women will be saved through childbearing&#151;if they
continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.</p>
