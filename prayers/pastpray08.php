<br>Prayer #8
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Almighty One, God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, we 
thank You and worship You for countless reasons. Right now, we worship You 
because You are patient and longsuffering. We know Lord, that Your patience is 
seen in Your desire that none perish, and that all come to repentance. We know 
that You often delay Your wrath. We also realize that You are patiently 
nurturing those who have been born again into Your family, helping us to be 
conformed to the image of Your Son and patiently working, despite our countless 
failures.</p>
<p>Lord, we need Your guidance within our church family. It 
seems we are surrounded by choices, and sometimes we feel like we are choosing 
between lesser evils and other times between greater goods. Your Word promises 
wisdom if we but ask, and, so Lord, we go on record before You as asking for 
that wisdom.</p>
<p>We also ask for your protection for our missionaries, as 
well as for we who serve you right here. We know, Lord, that life holds many 
dangers. We know the Evil One is out to thwart the work of Your kingdom, and we 
know that often unbelievers and even misguided brethren intentionally try to 
hinder Your work. We ask You to bind Satan, send angels to protect us, and 
deliver us from ungodly and unreasonable men.</p>
<p>As the Body of Christ, we are made up of many members. 
Some of our members are suffering, others are perhaps feeling expendable and 
unimportant, while others find themselves slaves to destructive habits. Others 
are rejoicing and exulting in the blessings of life. Perhaps most of us are 
somewhere in between, not exactly miserable but not completely happy either. Lord, cheer 
our hearts, encourage our spirits, help us to view our existence in light of 
eternity and our positions—whether humble or recognized—as opportunities to 
serve You. Help us to remember that life is not about us, it is about glorifying 
You.</p>
<p>We pray for our leaders, our troops, and true Christians 
everywhere. We pray that this world will turn to You as never before, that the 
persecution of believers would stop, and that the Gospel would go forth 
mightily.</p>
<p>We pray these things in Jesus’ Name, Amen</p>
