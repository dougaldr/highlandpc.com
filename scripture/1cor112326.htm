<p><sup>23</sup> For I received from the Lord what I also 
passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
<sup>24</sup> and when he had given thanks, he broke it and 
said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”
<sup>25</sup> In the same way, after supper he took the cup, 
saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink 
it, in remembrance of me.” <sup>26</sup> For whenever you eat 
this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</p>
