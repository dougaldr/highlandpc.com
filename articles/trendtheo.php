<br>Trends in Theology and Your Pastor
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>
<p>
You cannot be a maturing Christian 
without getting into theology. You do not have to use $10,000 words, but you 
want to understand God and the things of God if the Spirit of God lives in you. 
And make no mistake about it, what you believe affects how you live and the 
choices you make.</p>
<p>
Theology is the science of God and 
pretty much anything connected to the things of God. The word &quot;theos&quot; means 
&quot;God&quot; and &quot;logy&quot; means the &quot;logic of or science of.&quot; When we study God Himself, 
we are studying &quot;Theology Proper.&quot; Other aspects of God’s revelation include 
&quot;Soteriology&quot; (salvation) and &quot;Eschatology&quot; (end-time events) to name a few.</p>
<p>
Although truth stays the same, our 
understanding of truth changes. This &quot;change of understanding&quot; can be positive 
or negative. If we abandon an accurate understanding of truth for an inaccurate 
one, such change is obviously negative. If, on the other hand, we hone our 
understanding toward accuracy, that would represent a positive change.</p>
<p>
As Evangelical Christians, we 
profess that God’s truth is unchangeable, and that the only infallible source of 
truth is God’s Word, the Bible. We also agree that a Bible verse means 
primarily one thing (with the exception of prophecy which may have both a less 
literal and a more literal fulfillment), and that, whatever a verse means, it 
has always meant that. The true meaning of a verse does not change: our 
understanding of it either improves or declines.</p>
<p>
Trends are always floating around 
the evangelical world, as well as among other forms of Christianity, some for 
the better, most (it seems) for the worse. Virtually anything and everything we 
believe is open for challenge and reevaluation, and perhaps this is good: truth 
will stand up to a fair and honest challenge. Unfortunately, in my view, some 
of these challenges are not fair, honest, or objective, but are motivated by an 
agenda other than getting to the original intent of the Bible’s human authors 
(and, since God inspired them, an agenda against God Himself). I am especially 
irritated when assumptions are treated as though they were established facts.</p>
<p>
If these theological trends were 
encapsulated in seminaries and colleges, I would not need to bother with this 
article. But the truth is that theological trends trickle down to our 
churches. If you are active in the Kingdom of God, you may have already come 
across a few of them. If not, be patient: you will. So let me summarize and 
comment upon some of these trends.</p>
<p>
One trend I think is positively 
great: the trend toward “Progressive Dispensationalism.” Although this term is 
a mouthful, it refers to a system of interpretation that recognizes that God 
will keep His promises to the literal nation of Israel. Unlike Replacement 
Theology (including the 16<sup>th</sup> century &quot;Covenant Theology&quot;), which says 
that the church replaces Israel, Progressive Dispensationalism says that the 
church is blessed through Israel, and that one day Israel will turn to Christ. 
Although the paradigm of Traditional Dispensationalism has 
been around since the 18<sup>th</sup> Century, Progressive Dispensationalism is 
distinct in that it recognizes that the church is anticipated in the Old 
Testament. It asserts that many Old Testament prophecies have a limited (less 
literal) fulfillment in the church while anticipating a more literal fulfillment 
in the coming Millennial Kingdom. This new twist upon Dispensationalism clears 
up a lot of interpretative headaches, includes the fulfillment of Joel’s 
prophecy in <b>Acts 2</b>.</p>
<p>
I label the other trends listed 
below as negative ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><i>
Negative trend one:</u></i> The &quot;New 
Perspective&quot; on the apostle Paul. E. P. Sanders wrote a work over 25 years ago 
that asserts that our understanding of justification is based upon the &quot;Lutheran 
captivity of Romans.&quot; According to the &quot;New Perspective,&quot; Paul believed one 
enters the New Covenant by God’s grace through faith, but that one remains in 
the New Covenant by faithfulness to God’s commands and keeping the Law. Like 
other false systems of salvation, man and God cooperate for salvation. But 
Paul clearly teaches us that salvation is totally a work of God, and no part of 
it is of ourselves 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph289.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).</p>
<p><u><i>
Negative trend two:</u></i> &quot;Open Theism.&quot; 
This is the belief, advocated by Clark Pinnock and others, that God does not 
know what is going to happen before it does. He only knows what is real, and, 
since the future is not real right now, God does not know it. According to this 
view, God can project what is likely to happen, but our free will presents him 
with a constant wild card. Besides contradicting a vast array of Scripture, 
Open Theism advocates a weakened God who would prevent disasters if he knew they 
were coming. This god might be interesting, but he is not the Sovereign God of 
the Bible! Yet this view is gaining popularity.</p>
<p>
The Bible teaches that God knows 
everything beforehand, down to the detail. <b>Psalm 139:4</b> reads, &quot;Before a word is 
on my tongue you know it completely, O L<span class=sm>ORD</span>.&quot;</p>
<p><u><i>
Negative trend three:</u></i> &quot;Rejection of 
Imputed Righteousness.&quot; Robert Gundry has led the charge against the idea that 
when we accept Christ, we are legally given Christ’s righteousness. Like the 
&quot;New Perspective&quot; on Paul, all of a sudden the Bible does not mean what we have 
taken it to mean these centuries. Although it is true that as we walk with the 
Lord, we become more righteous, it is not this righteousness that makes us right 
with God. Additionally, we do not grow into the righteousness of Christ: we 
have it now.</p>
<p>
Salvation is a present possession, 
not merely a future hope.</p>
<p>
The Word is clear: in <b>Philippians 
3:9</b>, Paul declares how he gave up non-Messianic Judaism and accepted Christ so 
that He might, &quot;be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes 
from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that 
comes from God and is by faith…&quot; and <b>2 Corinthians 5:21</b>, &quot;God made him who had 
no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the 
righteousness of God.&quot; The &quot;Great Exchange&quot; worked two ways: we gave Jesus our 
sin; He gave us His righteousness. That’s the heart of the Gospel.</p>
<p><u><i>
Negative trend four:</u></i> Politically 
correct theology. This covers many issues. All of a sudden the Bible no longer 
means what we thought it meant for centuries, whether we are talking about women 
pastors, homosexuality, the eternality of hell, the impossibility of salvation 
apart from faith in Christ, or a &quot;gender neutral Bible.&quot; If we have any 
convictions at all, we are considered intolerant; we are only allowed to have 
preferences. If we speak out against error, we are guilty of judging (but it is 
okay for others to judge you as being judgmental…figure it out!).</p>
<p><u><i>
Negative trend five:</u></i> &quot;Believers who 
are not born-again are still saved.&quot; Although it is true that all who believe 
in the Lord Jesus Christ are saved, it is impossible to believe in a saving way 
without being born again. So promoting Christendom or religion is replacing the 
call for individuals to personally covenant with God. All of a sudden people 
who are religious but have not been born again are to be considered as brothers 
and sisters. </p>
<p>
We need to recall what Jesus told 
Nicodemus, &quot;Unless a man is born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God&quot; (<b>John 
3:3</b>). If an individual has not been resurrected to spiritual life, religion 
cannot save his soul. We need to reaffirm this most basic evangelical belief.</p>
<p><u><i>
Negative trend six:</u></i> &quot;The Emerging 
Church&quot; movement. The movement, lead by Brian McClaren advocates a &quot;dumbed 
down&quot; Christianity that is more about action and ignores important doctrines. 
Biblical literacy is not crucial, but instead, a &quot;Christianity for the sake of 
Christianity&quot; attitude prevails in McClaren’s works, in my opinion. Dangerous 
stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such challenges to sound doctrine 
are not new. They will certainly continue and intensify because many within the 
Bible-believing community are uncomfortable with the clear but sometimes 
offensive teaching of God’s Word. So, all of a sudden, God no longer means what 
He says. The temptation to rationalize God’s Word to make it more palatable to 
the current culture will nurture compromise after compromise.</p>
<p>
Fortunately, we live a day when 
solid Christians have many resources. Some of these movements will fade into 
oblivion; others may plague us for decades. But, as a Christian, you need to be 
on the lookout because one thing is certain: false teachers are experts at 
making their errors seem good and reasonable. That is why you cannot merely 
rely on your instincts: we all need to learn to think critically. But to think 
critically, we must have a solid foundation based upon a knowledge of God’s 
Word.</p>
