<p>Lord,</p>
<p>You are the God of the remnant. We human beings love 
to follow the herd instinct. We imitate what is around us, gain our bearing 
from others and generally feel more comfortable following the pack. Some of 
this is good. It is the way You made us. We ought to be team players; we ought 
to be social. But You call Your children out of the world for Your special 
purposes, yet we are to remain in the world: connected to society, but 
different, in some regards, from the norm. By seeding us throughout society, 
You want us to live lives that impress the lost. This provides opportunities to 
give Your Gospel a hearing, but it also brings glory to You, whether people 
believe or not. You whittled down Gideon's army to prove it was You Who fought 
the battle. So the Kingdom of God expands not by force or manipulation, but by 
Your Spirit working through us. You take pleasure in Your &quot;called out&quot; ones.</p>
<p>Help me to resist temptation and the lures of Satan 
today. May I be alert to his schemes and take up the armor of God.</p>
<p>Lord, I remember my country's chief executive officer 
(President, Prime Minister, Secretary General, etc.) and our legislative and 
judicial branches. May all these leaders favor true and complete 
religious freedom. Help them to govern with righteousness and equity.</p>
<p>Today I remember youth who are participating in Christian 
camps. Bless them with safety, health, discernment and wisdom. Help them 
embrace truth and dismiss error. May those campers who do not know Jesus Christ 
come to know Him; guide those who already do know Him to dedicate their lives to 
You. Speak to them, Lord. May they have good, clean fun and return home 
inspired and satisfied. </p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the Guizhou Province of China with its 37 
million people and 39 people groups. Father, a few of those groups have seen 
Your Gospel take root deeply. Overall, 3.9% of the population claim some form 
of Christianity, mostly evangelical. But while some people groups have many 
Christians, others have very little and some have none. Lord, help the Gospel to 
spread throughout each of these people groups! May the percentage of believers 
double over the next five years in this province. Give the believers wisdom so 
that they might avoid the persecution of the government.</p>
<p>O Lord, bless the work of Prison Fellowship International (PFI), the world’s largest network of prison 
ministries, more than 100,000 volunteers serving the Body of Christ behind bars 
in over 100 countries.... PFI’s mission is to work through the Christian 
community to meet the spiritual and physical needs of prisoners, ex-prisoners, 
victims and their families and to promote Biblical standards of restorative 
justice. PFI serves its ministries through short-term assistance projects 
(medical, technical), HIV/AIDS prevention, vocational training for inmates, 
micro-lending for ex-offenders and inmates’ spouses, leadership training, 
victim-offender reconciliation, etc. Thank You that they share the Good News 
of Jesus Christ in the process and thank You for many who come to know You 
through this work. Empower them by Your Spirit, protect, provide, guide and 
bless, I ask.</p>
<p>Now use me to 
share the Good News, I pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
