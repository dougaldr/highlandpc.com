<p><sup>1</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, &quot;Go 
to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> says: Let my people go, so 
that they may worship me. <sup>2</sup> If you 
refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
<sup>3</sup> The Nile will teem with frogs. They 
will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the 
houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading 
troughs. <sup>4</sup> The frogs will go up on you 
and your people and all your officials.' &quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>5</sup> Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said to Moses, 
&quot;Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals 
and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.' &quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>6</sup> So Aaron stretched out his hand 
over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.
<sup>7</sup> But the magicians did the same 
things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>8</sup> Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron 
and said, &quot;Pray to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I 
will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>9</sup> Moses said to Pharaoh, &quot;I leave 
to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials 
and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for 
those that remain in the Nile.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>10</sup> &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Pharaoh said. </p>
<p>Moses replied, &quot;It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no 
one like the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> our God. <sup>11</sup> The 
frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will 
remain only in the Nile.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>12</sup> After Moses and Aaron left 
Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
<sup>13</sup> And the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> did what Moses asked. 
The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.
<sup>14</sup> They were piled into heaps, and the 
land reeked of them. <sup>15</sup> But when 
Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to 
Moses and Aaron, just as the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had said.</p>
