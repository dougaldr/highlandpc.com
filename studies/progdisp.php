<p>As I was reading Robert Saucy’s thoughtful book, <i>The 
Case for Progressive Dispensationalism</i>, Saucy highlighted what should be 
(but often is not) an obvious thought in the realm of hermeneutics (principles 
of Bible interpretation):</p>
<blockquote>Typology, it is generally agreed, does not eliminate the 
historicity of the type. This is universally accepted with regard to the 
historical Israel’s living under the old covenant. But what about Israel of the 
eschatological time portrayed in the prophets, the Israel related to the reign 
of the future Davidic king? The church is often viewed as typologically 
replacing Israel in these prophecies. What, then, happens to the historicity of 
the type, if the type is not historical Israel living under the old covenant, but 
the future Israel enjoying messianic salvation under the new covenant? (p. 31)</blockquote>
<p>In other words, why should we take Old Testament history 
literally, since the church draws applications from that history, while many 
allegorize Old Testament prophecy? We recognize that drawing an application 
from the Torah does not mean the events recorded in the Torah were not literal. 
So why should we negate the literal fulfillment of God's promises to Israel just 
because the church draws application from them? We shouldn't.</p>
<p>Although Saucy and I came to embrace the same hermeneutical 
paradigm (<i>Progressive Dispensationalism</i>), we arrived there by differing 
routes. <b>My observation, namely, that most prophecy has a near, less literal 
fulfillment and a distant, more literal fulfillment led me to see that the 
eschatological promises made to Israel are first fulfilled in the church (<i>in 
a less literal way</i>) and then fulfilled <i>more literally</i> to the literal 
descendents of Jacob (ethnic Israel) in the End Times.</b></p>
<p>But Saucy’s comments activated my gray cells when it comes 
to the realm of Old Testament types, particularly the typology of the Law (as 
indicated by <b>Hebrews 10:1a</b>, “The law is only a shadow of the good things that 
are coming—not the realities themselves”).</p>
<p>What is prophecy, but history written “in advance?&quot; When 
God speaks, his declarations about our future are no less certain than His 
recollections of those past. To claim that God redefines His terminology, as 
does Replacement Theology (e.g., “Israel no longer means the genetic descendents 
of Jacob”) and that He changes terms and conditions after the fact (transforming 
unconditional promises to conditional) or allegorizes what is originally clearly 
literal is absolute nonsense. This would be considered underhanded in our 
society, but it is shady in the realm of theology as well. But when we accuse 
God of this redefining of terms, the implication is that God does not know what 
the future holds; He must change His plans in response to human decisions. 
Things weren’t going so well with Israel, so now God is going to redefine who 
and what Israel is! It doesn’t matter how Jeremiah understood God’s prophecies 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/jer313537.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>, 
for example), or how David or Abraham understood them; God 
is now redefining terminology so He can move away from the original 
understanding of the contract. Sorry, I don’t buy that.</p>
<p>If we believe in a Sovereign, Omniscient God Who exists 
outside the realm of time, a God Who sees all events of all time at every 
moment, it follows that prophecy is just as certain as history. From God’s 
perspective, there really is no difference.</p>
<p>Combining Saucy’s insights with my &quot;near—less literal, far—more literal&quot; view of prophecy gives us a mirror reflection for history, with 
the church characterized by the &quot;less literal&quot; application in both instances; 
here is the paradigm I would like to suggest.</p>

<p>When it comes to prophecy, there is a difference between 
its style and that of narrative history. Many prophecies were given in the 
poetic genre, which is why we have the &quot;more literal&quot; and &quot;less literal&quot; 
categories (vs. literal and less literal).</p>
<p>Understood in this manner, <i>Progressive Dispensationalism</i> 
becomes simple to understand. It also becomes an obvious hermeneutic in line 
with the tenor of Scripture.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, <i>Progressive Dispensationalism</i></p>
<ul>
	<li>Is NOT Replacement Theology; God will keep His 
	promises made to “Israel according to the flesh,” the genetic descendents of 
	Jacob.</li>
	<li>Acknowledges a future 7-year Tribulation followed by a 
	1,000 Millennium with Christ personally present and reigning from Jerusalem.</li>
	<li>Believes that the nation of Israel (in the Millennium) 
	will be exalted as a nation with a rebuilt Temple and sacrifices (that the 
	Messianic Age is compatible with Temple worship is demonstrated in 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/acts211726.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 21:17-26</a>).</li>
	<li>Is similar to David Stern’s “Olive Branch Theology” 
	espoused in <i>Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel.</i></li>
	<li>Does see the church fulfilling many Old Testament 
	prophecies, but in a less literal sense or in an incomplete sense; the 
	church was anticipated in the Old Testament, but not clearly; hence, the 
	term mystery is not defined as &quot;previously unrevealed,&quot; but &quot;previously 
	revealed <i>unclearly</i>.&quot;</li>
	<li>Views the church as being blessed through Israel; God 
	has never stopped working with Israel (some Jews believe, and He is 
	provoking others to jealousy; they will rebuild the Tribulation Temple 
	largely in unbelief; although the 144,000 will be saved during the earlier 
	part of the Tribulation, most Jews will not believe until the Battle of 
	Armageddon according to <b>Zechariah 12</b>).</li>
	<li>Essentially recognizes the more literal fulfillment of 
	prophecy (which is Traditional Dispensationalism’s strong suit) but does not 
	ignore how the New Testament authors quote and apply the Old Testament to 
	the church (Traditional Dispensationalism’s weakest suit and the reason we 
	need a better paradigm).</li>
	<li>Is a &quot;now, but not yet&quot; viewpoint (as argued by C. 
	Marvin Pate); the Kingdom Age is, in a sense, breaking forth now, but will 
	have a complete fulfillment during the Millennium.</li>
</ul>
