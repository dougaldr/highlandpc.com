<p><sup>27</sup> People were eating, drinking, marrying and 
being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came 
and destroyed them all. </p>
<p><sup>28</sup> “It was the same in the days of Lot. People 
were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
<sup>29</sup> But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur 
rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.” </p>
