<p><sup>5</sup> He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel,
</p>

<p>which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children, </p>

<p><sup>6</sup> so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to
be born, and they in turn would tell their children. </p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his
deeds but would keep his commands.</p>
