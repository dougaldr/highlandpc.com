<br>A Prayer for Those Who Have Lost A Child
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Lord, You are the God Who sees,</p>
<p>And it is my prayer that You would see my misery and grief 
and comfort me. O God, I am so empty, I feel so helpless, so trapped in a grief 
that is bigger than I. Lord, I expect certain tragedies in life, but no one 
expects to lose a child. A parent, yes. A sibling, possibly. A spouse, 
perhaps. But not a child, Lord. This is a complete nightmare.</p>
<p>Lord, I have no choice but to either go through this 
horrible trauma with You or without You. I cannot reverse it, no matter how I 
try to bargain with You. I can question Your goodness or doubt Your wisdom, I 
could deny You and try to hate You, but, Lord, that would not bring back my 
child. I would be cutting myself off from my best source of help and comfort. 
No, I’ve never needed You as much as I need you right now.</p>
<p>Lord, there is a big hole inside of me. Sometimes the hole 
seems bigger than what is left of me. Others try to comfort me, and they mean 
well. Their love does sometimes help, at least for a little while. But then the 
reality of it all hits me again: my child is gone, and I will not see that 
special person until I reach heaven. And it seems such a long time!</p>
<p>Father, I had dreams about my child’s future. I know that 
nothing is guaranteed in life, but I assumed that such horrific losses occurred 
in the lives of others; I never dreamt that death would strike down my own 
child!</p>
<p>O, Father, I do not seem able to bear it. But I thank You 
that You love me, and I know this not because of how life is, but because of 
Calvary. You demonstrated Your love by sending Jesus to die on the cross to bear 
my sins. I know You love because of Jesus, despite the apparently contradictory 
message of my tragic loss. Lord, I long to escape this world which is under Your 
curse! Yet, in the meantime, with Your help, I will trust You even though I do 
not understand. It is not even that I do not fully understand; I do not 
understand AT ALL.</p>
<p>Lord, please work within me. Help me to first get through 
these days, weeks, and months. Then help me to be able to cope and move on. I 
know You will never take all the pain away. I don’t want You to take all the 
pain away, because I loved my child too much to want to forget my loss. If I 
ceased to hurt, that would mean I have forgotten; I would die first. But help me 
limp forward with Your hand in mine and to find a new purpose in life and to 
adjust to living with the pain of heartache.</p>
<p>Lord, although others may attempt to comfort me with the 
promise of eternal life—as though it were some sort of drug to distract me 
from my loss—I know Your promise is true. If it were not true, life would be 
only vanity. But thank You that eternal life is the real destiny of Your 
children. So I do find a little comfort here. Thank You that the reunion ahead 
is real, not just wishful thinking. </p>
<p>So please help me, Lord, for I pray to You, God of all 
mercies, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
