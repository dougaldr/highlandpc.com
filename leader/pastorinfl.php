<br>The Fluidity of Pastoral Influence

<p>Pastoral leadership within a church is far from an exact 
science; it can be approached from many, many angles. No angle is complete, but 
most of them contribute toward a deeper understanding of what should be--or 
what actually IS--within local congregations.</p>
<p>Churches vary in their structures, but in most 
congregations, members look to their pastor for leadership (in theory), but this 
does not always mean that a pastor is the most influential leader (in practice).</p>
<p>In the typical evangelical church (small or medium in 
size), the pastor shares his leadership role in a variety of ways. But his 
influence typically changes over time (which is why long tenure is important). 
Let's analyze how leadership is shared and how influence changes in typical 
situations.</p>
<p>The typical definition of leadership sounds something like 
&quot;influence, initiative, and setting direction.&quot; Books on leadership often view 
the pastor as a sanctified CEO, the one responsible for whatever happens within 
a congregation. Small and medium churches do not necessarily embrace this modern 
concept of a pastor, and it is questionable as to whether they should. In some 
congregations, the pastor is blamed for what goes wrong, but the Lord or others 
are given credit for what goes right. The idea that God might want a church 
event to flop is ruled out <i>a priori</i>, and some congregations do not 
recognize the importance of sharing encouragement and praise for hard work; God 
will keep people humble--we do not need to help Him!).</p>
<p>Perhaps a more Biblical understanding is that a pastor is 
one of several elders. He is an elder who leads well and works hard at preaching 
and teaching; he is therefore worthy of double honor 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1tim517.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Timothy 5:17</a>). 
This double honor implies financial support 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1tim518.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Timothy 5:18</a>), 
but also implies <i>a double portion</i> of <i>influence, which is a consequence 
of being held in honor</i>. Nonetheless, such an elder's influence needs limits 
(which is why major decisions should be made by the board); he is expected to work 
in harmony with the other elders as a team player.</p>
<p>So how does one translate these concepts into modern 
practice, especially considering that many churches do not even have officers 
labeled as &quot;elders?&quot; Most smaller (and even many medium-sized churches) are 
<i>actually</i> controlled by influential families, even if these family members do 
not sit on the board. The board may be the visible decision-making body, but 
without support of the key families, even a board resolution will flop. It is 
better to work with this reality than to try to thwart it (unless we are talking 
about a matter of obedience to clear Scripture). So how can a pastor aim for 
positive influence (what should be) while serving in the current situation (what 
is)?</p>
<p>One way to understand the modern role between the pastor 
and his church leaders (whether that leadership is the official board or key 
families) is to view two separate functions of leadership: <i>expertise</i> and
<i>authority</i>.</p>
<p>Here is a typical case study. A pastoral candidate becomes 
the pastor of Community Church. He has served one other congregation for three 
years and has graduated from a respected Bible college or seminary. He is 
immediately given some respect because he has a level of expertise (education 
and theological experience). He must then prove his expertise in practical ways, 
demonstrating that he can preach well, conduct funerals and weddings in a 
reasonable way, model the Christian life, minister to the sick, and prove he is 
strong when it comes to people skills (practical expertise). As the congregation 
gets to see him in action, he builds rapport. His respect <i>as an expert</i> 
grows. </p>
<p><i>Authority</i> is a very different issue. Since life 
deals us many wild cards, we gravitate toward authorities that are established 
and long-term. In some congregations, pastoral tenures are short. Therefore, 
reason leads many to lean upon long-term authority, not pastors (who might be 
here today and gone tomorrow). You might go to the new doctor for medicine, but 
you want mom to cook the chicken soup and rub the ointment on your chest!</p>
<p>This division of authority between pastor and board (or key 
families) is a double-edged sword. </p>
<p>On the positive side, sharing of leadership keeps pastors 
from gaining too much authority and being unchecked: &quot;absolute power corrupts 
absolutely&quot; (Lord Acton). Most of us have seen ministries led by benevolent 
dictators. We may have seen some led by not-so-benevolent dictators!</p>
<p>Additionally, this sharing of leadership helps develop lay 
leaders and provide for church continuity. Too strong a pastor can make for weak 
lay leadership. If lay leaders are engaged in active ministry, shared leadership 
is ideal. But woe to the pastor who is under the thumb of armchair critics who 
are AWOL when it comes to actually serving in the church! When idle leaders view 
their task as assigning work for the pastor, it might be time to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>But if preventing pastoral corruption (through too much 
authority) is the positive edge of the sword, the negative edge is just as 
sharp: the accommodation of firmly entrenched, control-freak laymen who view the 
pastor as their hired hand (and slave). Such control freaks may even seek to 
micromanage a pastor's ministerial, personal and family life (school choices, 
clothing styles, leisure time, sermon topics etc.). This is particularly a 
problem in small rural congregations (or people who were raised in such 
churches).</p>
<p>As a pastor builds relationships and gets a few years under 
his belt, he begins to gain more authority. Every crisis he survives means more 
respect. This can take two directions.</p>
<p>In unhealthy churches (where control-freak families are 
entrenched), leaders may become critical of the pastor (and seek his removal) if 
they fear he is gaining too much influence (because that means less influence 
for them). This explains why some churches are noted for repeated firings (or 
frequent pastoral turnover). They may suggest the pastor become part-time or 
dump more and more responsibilities upon him, thus motivating him to look 
elsewhere. A criticism campaign, unfortunately, is a tried and true method for 
shedding pastors.</p>
<p>In healthy churches, the opposite occurs: the pastor's 
influence grows; the leaders gain more respect for the pastor as each year 
passes. The relationship between board and pastor resembles a happy marriage. 
Differences are worked out with compromise and calm discussion. The pastor finds 
his &quot;groove,&quot; and the church begins coming to life.</p>
<p>As his influence grows, another danger lurks: the pastor 
can be tempted to surround himself by &quot;yes&quot; men and refuse to share leadership 
decisions. Rather than &quot;double honor,&quot; his opinion counts more than the sum 
total of the entire board (or key families)! This is where the pastor is 
confronted with a fork in the road: he can either choose to remember his 
theology or he can trash it all and bank on expediency. If he chooses the 
former, he begins to conceal his opinions about issues out of his domain; he 
recognizes that his opinions carry more weight than they should (they are no 
longer merely opinions). He must determine to continue being a team player and 
accept not always getting his way.</p>
<p>Church life is best (1) when a pastor has earned respect 
because of his expertise, (2) when he has more influence than any one individual 
but not so much that his decisions become law, and (3) when the church board 
(not the pastor alone) is the final word in extra-Scriptural matters.</p>
