<p> <sup> 3</sup> Or don't you
know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his
death?&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death
in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, we too may live a new life.</p>
