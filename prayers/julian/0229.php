<br>February 29

<p>Great God,</p>
<p>Today is a unique day, a date that is only on the calendar 
one in four years. Yet time is irrelevant to You. Because You completely 
master all there is, we can run to You as our shield. Time is Your time; the 
massive energy within each atom Your plaything. Because You are predisposed 
toward we who are in Christ, we can flee behind You as our shield. Whether it 
is Satan's fiery darts or the trials of life, You want to be our Shield of 
shelter.</p>
<p>Help me to resist temptation and the lures of the Satan 
today. May I draw near to You so that You will draw near to me. Help me resist 
the devil so he will flee.</p>
<p>Since this is obviously a leap year, that means elections 
are not far behind. This Fall, we will make some important decisions here in 
the U.S. Guide us in our voting, and help us to trust that You are working 
Your purposes in Your Providence.</p>
<p>Help me to look not only at my own things, but to 
unselfishly love others. May this love begin with those closest to me: family, 
friends, neighbors, and then spread outward.</p>
<p>Today I pray for all missionaries throughout this world who 
are true to the Gospel and the fundamentals of Your Word. Prosper them, guide 
them, protect them, and provide for them. Your Holy Spirit is infinite, for He 
is God. May He sovereignly move in our world to produce great fruit. Today we 
especially pray for the Muslim people. Muslims are often very committed to 
their religion, but they merely acknowledge Jesus as a great prophet. They do 
not recognize Him as God, nor do they believe He died on the cross for our sins 
and rose again. We pray that through the Jesus Film and other means, that You 
would reap a great harvest from within Islamic lands.&nbsp; We also pray that people 
of all religions would recognize the importance of respecting religious freedom, 
whether it works for or against us.</p>
<p>We remember our persecuted brothers and sisters in Christ. 
We especially remember the Voice of the Martyrs as they seek to connect us with 
information and prayer needs for those in nations where persecution is 
severest. We especially pray for Sudan, China, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, and 
Viet Nam. We pray that these governments would recognize the rights given by 
our Creator, including the right to practice and propagate religion. Help the 
believers in these lands to be wise beyond themselves and thus able to thwart 
persecution. When they cannot, help them to be strong in your strength and not 
their own.</p>
<p>Help me serve You faithfully today, I pray, in Jesus' Name, 
Amen.</p>
