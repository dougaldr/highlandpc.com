<br>Major Players in the World of First-Century Judaism

<p>In order to understand some of the events in the Gospels, it is important for us to 
understand the key players in first-century Judaism. We will list them by 
category.</p>
<p><u><b>The Pharisees</b></u> 
This is by far the most important category. The Pharisees were “separated 
ones.” When the Greek culture began threatening Jewish ways, devout Jews who 
resisted compromising their beliefs formed this group called the Pharisees. 
They followed the solid teaching presented by Ezra and took the Scriptures very 
seriously. Modern Orthodox Jews descended from the Pharisees. Despite the 
hypocrisy of some Pharisees, particularly those with a lot of authority, many of 
them were sincere and devout. Christ strongly condemned those Pharisees noted 
for hypocrisy, which tended to be the more outspoken of the group.</p>
<p>
Christian beliefs more closely match those of the Pharisees than any other group 
of the era. They believed the entire Old Testament and in the realities of 
heaven and hell. Besides the hypocrisy of some, the downfall of most was that 
they added accumulated traditions to the Bible. There is a principle: when 
people focus on traditions, the Word of God is displaced. One only has so much 
time and energy, and concentrating in one area means depleting another. 
Although they acknowledged the Word of God, the concentration of many Pharisees 
were the traditions added by men.</p>
<p>The 
common people did not belong to the order of Pharisees, but they looked to the 
Pharisees for direction. Since the Pharisees set the tone for the majority of 
Jews, when the Pharisee leaders rejected Christ, one could say that the Jews 
rejected Christ, even though many individual Jews, like the apostles, did 
believe.</p>
<p><u><b>The Scribes</b></u> 
were Pharisees who copied, expounded, and taught the Scriptures. They were an 
early form of the modern Rabbi. These people are sometimes referred to as 
&quot;teachers of the law&quot; or &quot;lawyers.&quot;</p>
<p><u><b>The Sadducees</b></u> 
were the theological liberals of Judaism. They were wealthy and powerful. The 
high priestly families were Sadducees. They did not believe in angels or 
demons; only recognized the first five books of the Bible (the Torah); and did 
not believe in the after life. (that’s why they were “sad, you see.”) They 
owned the concession business outside the Temple area.</p>
<p><u><b>The Sanhedrin</b></u> 
are also referred to as the “elders, chief priests, and scribes.” The Sanhedrin 
was the “Supreme Court” of Israel, with limited authority allowed by the 
Romans. To execute the death penalty, the Sanhedrin needed permission from the 
Roman governor. Understanding this explains the repeated trials Christ 
experienced. Not all the members of Sanhedrin wanted to crucify Christ: 
Nicodemus fought the decision, it is possible that Joseph of Arimathea was also 
part of the Sanhedrin. The leader, Gamaliel, was probably absent during Jesus' 
trial.</p>
