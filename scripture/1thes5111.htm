<p><sup>1</sup> Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to
you, <sup>2</sup> for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like
a thief in the night.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> While people are saying, &quot;Peace and
safety,&quot; destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a
pregnant woman, and they will not escape.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should
surprise you like a thief.&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> You are all sons of the light and sons
of the day.&nbsp; We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> So
then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and
self-controlled.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup> For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who
get drunk, get drunk at night.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> But since we belong to the day, let
us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope
of salvation as a helmet.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> For God did not appoint us to suffer
wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> He
died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with
him.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup> Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just
as in fact you are doing.</p>
