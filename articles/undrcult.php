<br>Tools for Warfare: Understanding Cults and Religions
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Before I became a Christian, I was not naturally curious. I read what I
had to read for school. But when it came to reading based on my choice, I
stuck to murder mysteries. I could think when I had to but only did so IF
I saw a self-serving reason. I would not exert those little gray cells
needlessly, which is one reason I will never develop a love for chess, for
example. Since thinking sometimes did offer positive consequences, I
engaged in it when motivated. For example, I earned good grades in school
but had little interest in current events. I was an unambitious,
unmotivated young man. Before I came to know Jesus, I preferred to keep my
head in the sand where the stress level was low and where I did not have to take
on any else's problems. I did have compassion on those I came across, but
I did not look for opportunities to serve.</p>
<p>When I became a born-again Christian, my life changed dramatically in many
ways. One effect of my conversion was a motivation to activate my whole
being, including my mind. Things I had no interest in before&#8212;the Bible,
doctrine, missions, evangelism, scientific creationism, apologetics, ethics,
world views, serving others, decision making, prayer, and a whole lot more&#8212;now
mattered very much. I was not necessarily drawn to these things, but I
wanted to be useful to the Lord and I realized that these were the tools to the
trade of being an effective Christian. Believe me, it wasn't my nature to
pour myself into these areas. Unlike people bent upon intellectual or
spiritual pursuits who find pleasure pursuing these things, I began to pursue
them out of pure conviction. I needed a reason to think, a purpose to
energize myself (or, more accurately, a willingness to allow God's Spirit to
energize me).</p>
<p>Because I wanted to serve Christ, I had to be equipped for evangelism (among
other things), and one area of &quot;being equipped&quot; is understanding what
other people believe&#8212;not out of mere curiosity but to understand how to best
witness to them. Other reasons for such knowledge include keeping
ourselves and those we love from error and entrapment, as well as learning to
become lovers of truth. After receiving a call to the pastoral ministry,
my motivation became a bit greater, but most of this spiritual &quot;surge&quot;
came out of conviction, while I was yet a layman.</p>
<p>The reason you and I need to understand the basics of world religions and
cults is not for mere intellectual pursuit, but for ministry&#8212;our personal
ministries. It is true, for example, that we are highly unlikely to
convert the Jehovah's Witness or Mormon who comes to our door (and it is
probably a waste of time and energy to try). They have an agenda and are
not interested in considering alternatives. But if we have family members,
friends, or neighbors who get sucked into these things, our knowledge may come
in handy. We have at least a chance of winning those with whom we have
developed a relationship. This may be even more true among those raised in
these false religions. And, hopefully, we can spiritually vaccinate
ourselves and our families with truth to prevent spiritual causalities.</p>
<p>On Sunday evenings at 6:30, beginning July 14<sup>th</sup>, we will begin a series of
lessons comparing both major religions and &quot;Christian&quot; cults with
Biblical Christianity. Although we cannot address them all, we will look
at Islam, Eastern Religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, New Age, etc.), Roman
Catholicism, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Mormonism, among others.</p>
<p>The study of cults and false religions falls under the broader category of
apologetics. Apologetics simply means a defense of our faith. We are
attacked from many angles (as are all religious, philosophical, or moral
viewpoints). Some adversaries (besides Satan himself) include false
religions, atheism (a false religion in itself), theological liberalism (e.g.,
&quot;The Jesus Seminar&quot;), Darwinism (evolutionary theory), Marxism,
existentialism, and materialism, to name a few.</p>
<p>Our special "creation nights" help answer our questions about the claims of  
the theory of evolution. My new addition to the Sunday Night Mix, titled &quot;Apologetics
Night,&quot; addresses general apologetical issues like, &quot;How do we know
the Bible is true?&quot; or &quot;Are miracles possible?&quot; This series
about cults and world religions is a likewise a sub-category of apologetics.</p>
<p>A pastor's job is to train church attenders to do the work of the ministry
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph41113.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Ephesians 4:11-13</a>)
so that they are mature, doctrinally stable, and equipped to do
all the good things God intends them to do. Hopefully our newfound
emphasis on apologetics will help do just that. Logic and reason cannot
force someone into the Kingdom of God, nor can a good defense. But just as
we cannot save anyone, only point them to Christ, so apologetics&#8212;an
answer&#8212;can be used of the Spirit of God (who is, after all, the Spirit of
Truth).</p>
<p>Additionally, we too struggle with doubt. We all question God or His
Word. Apologetics is for us as well. Because we are Christians, we should
love truth. Truth asks questions. We can't answer them all, but we
can take a stab at most of them. And that's what apologetics are about,
answering questions and objections.
