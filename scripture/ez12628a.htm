<p><sup>26</sup> Above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne 
of sapphire, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. 
<sup>27</sup> I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like 
glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; 
and brilliant light surrounded him. <sup>28</sup> Like the appearance of a rainbow 
in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him.</p>
