<br>Pilate: A Friend to Caesar or Not?
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span>

<p>The year was 33 AD. Jesus had been arrested and illegally tried. From a human perspective, His life was hanging in the balance 
before Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor who desired to release 
Christ. To complicate matters, the governor's wife had experienced a troubling 
dream and encouraged him to treat Jesus well. Yet when the incited mob bellowed 
out, &quot;If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar,&quot;
Pilate submitted to the whim of the mob. 
Why? Merely the fear of a riot alone?</p>
<p>Was Pilate 
enslaved by the opinion polls of the day? No, far from being gullible, Pilate 
had a track record of disregarding those under his authority. He had even gone 
so far as to mingle the blood of Galilean Jews with the animal sacrifices they 
offered at the Temple 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/luke171.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>Luke 17:1</a>). 
Pilate had provoked riots and enjoyed 
agitating hostility among the Jews. He was cruel, oppressive, and clearly in 
control. That is, up until 33 AD. What changed him? To grasp the answer, 
consider the Roman political situation of the day.</p>
<p>The 
Roman Emperor was called &quot;Caesar&quot; as a title (that's where the Russian word 
&quot;Czar&quot; originated). The &quot;Caesar&quot; was Tiberius, who decided to take life easy 
and vacation for years on end on the beautiful island of Capri. In charge of 
all his responsibilities was his trusted friend, Sejanus. Sejanus was so 
trusted, that when the Emperor's son and heir was poisoned in 23 AD, treachery 
by Sejanus was not even considered!</p>
<p>Sejanus hated the 
Jews. He had previously incited Tiberius against them, and in 26 AD, he 
appointed Pilate to govern Judea. Pilate was only too eager to please Sejanus 
and institute anti-Semitic policies. But Sejanus was not content with being 
second in command. He plotted to overthrow Tiberius; the emperor got wind of it 
and had Sejanus killed in late 32 AD.</p>
<p>Without Sejanus 
around to poison his disposition toward the Jews, Tiberius reversed the 
anti-Jewish policies of Sejanus and sent orders throughout the Empire to treat 
the Jews kindly. Tiberius also evaluated anyone appointed to office by 
Sejanus. He was naturally suspicious of their loyalty, and Pilate was no 
exception. His loyalty to the Emperor was suspect, to say the least. Tiberius 
must have asked, “If it came to a showdown between myself and Sejanus, who would 
Pilate have supported?” Was he truly loyal to &quot;Caesar?&quot;</p>
<p>When 
the crowd roared, &quot;If you let this man go, you are no friend to Caesar,&quot; one can 
imagine what went through Pilate's mind. He may have thought, &quot;If I let Jesus 
go, the crowd will report me and I’ll get in trouble with Tiberius. Since He 
claims to be a King, they will twist His words and claim I allowed the leader of 
a rebellion against Rome to go free.&quot; Thus Pilate had a choice, to do right or 
maintain his political position. When they added, &quot;We have no king but Caesar,&quot; 
the crowd, was, in essence, questioning Pilate’s loyalty to Tiberius. They were 
loyal—was he? Pilate's position was precarious.</p>
<p>
Pilate made his choice. So we too must choose between pleasing the crowd, or 
taking our stand with Jesus, even if it means loss of prestige, position, or 
career. Which choice will you make?

(Much of the documentation for this material, as well as a good case for the 33 
AD date, can be found in the book<u>,</u> <u>Chronological Aspects of the Life 
of Christ,</u> by Harold W. Hoehner, Zondervan, 1977. Many Bible scholars favor 
an AD 30 date instead; I side with Hoehner because of Pilate’s behavior).</p>
