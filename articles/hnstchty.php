<br>Honest Christianity

<p>One verse Christians frequently commit to memory is <b>1
Corinthians 10:13</b>: &quot;No temptation has seized you except what is common
to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what
you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so
that you can stand up under it.&quot; (NIV)</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>I have it memorized in the New American Standard
version, but regardless of the version, this verse is oozing with practical
implications. For example, it is great to know that whatever tempts you
also tempts many other people. Although people are not necessarily tempted
by the same things, there are no unique temptations. Perhaps what tempts
us most is determined by our personalities and experiences. For example,
some people raised in messed-up families become control freaks. Others are not
tempted with control issues, but they constantly fight materialism.&nbsp;
Although most people face a degree of sexual temptation, not everyone struggles
equally in that area.</p>
<p>The verse also goes on to say that God limits the temptations
He sends our way and that He provides a method for us to endure it. That
can involve anything from fleeing the circumstances (as Joseph fled when
Potiphar's wife attempted to seduce him) to distracting one's mind or keeping
busy. But this article is not so much about temptation as it is the fact
that so much of our life experiences are &quot;common to man.&quot;</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>Once in a while I'll ask someone for a ballpark
estimate. Here is a sample conversation: &quot;I have no idea what a
swimming pool costs. Can you give me an idea of about how much one would
cost, just a ballpark figure?&quot; Some folks would respond, much to my
irritation, &quot;Not much.&quot; What does that mean? It probably
depends upon their income. If we were to ask again, we might hear,
&quot;You know, not a lot.&quot; We can plead and beg these folks to give
us some kind of ballpark figure, but they refuse. But if we say, &quot;You
mean only a hundred dollars?&quot; They'll say, &quot;no, of course
not.&quot; Then they'll finally give you a ballpark figure.</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>Sometimes the same dynamic holds true within the
Christian community. As a new believer (and even a new pastor who
conversed with other pastors), I found many believers were tight-lipped and
secretive about their humanity. They never worried, instead they were
merely &quot;concerned.&quot; They always forgave, never held a grudge,
and all their struggles seemed past. It was as phony as a three-dollar
bill. These Christians were more concerned about looking good and
concealing their humanity than they were about helping others get a
&quot;ballpark&quot; idea about the Christian life lived out in this real world
of ours.</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>I recall my experiences as a young twenty-two-year-old
pastor, serving in the city of Chicago. My suburban pastor friends would
listen to some of the situations I had to deal with, but never stated what I
needed to hear: &quot;This person is unreasonable and seems mentally
troubled,&quot; or &quot;We all have nutty people to deal with. Some
people are just messes who blame everyone and everything else for their
woes.&quot; Why are we so hesitant to speak truthfully? Have we
learned to lie in the name of not being judgmental? Are we afraid to say
we do not know, or that some problems simply have no solutions?&nbsp;
Fortunately, my current pastor friends are direct and forthcoming. I love
those guys!</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>Being open and honest is not only important for our
own well-being, helping us to think more truthfully, it also provides a paradigm
for newer believers. Struggling newlyweds need to know that the marriages
of their godly seniors have had their rough spots and still sometimes do.&nbsp;
They need to know that being godly does not mean eliminating all interests and
hobbies and that Christ is not on their minds every moment, that the godly get
frustrated, that they have bad moods and sometimes worry and fret. They
are less-than-perfect parents, and may not always have the answers to all
behavioral problems. Sometimes they make bad financial decisions or put
off responsibilities or bite off more than they can chew. Sometimes they
get out of rhythm and struggle to have devotions. Sometimes they get
crotchety and critical. They can feel depressed, seethe with anger, might
struggle with cynical attitudes, get bogged down with trivia and detail, be
unrealistic, or have a hard time breaking habits. In short, they can be
like you. And our energies are better spent in growing than in concealing.</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>Growing in Jesus Christ means, among other things,
that we will overcome some of these problems. We will no longer be
characterized by these vices, at least to the degree that we once were.&nbsp;
Some of the examples mentioned about are not actually vices, just part of being
human. And we have to get comfortable with our humanity, not deny
it. And other people, particularly in the Body of Christ, need to see that
being human is a good thing, not something to pretend away.</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>When it comes to sins and vices, in some instances we
will experience total victory as we grow; in others frequent victory. In
some areas, we may simply tone down the weakness. And, if we are to be
completely realistic, in a few areas, we will make no substantial progress at
all. <b>But looking at our lives overall, others should easily see the
stamp of Jesus Christ all over the place.</p>
</b><font size="1">
<p></font>So, remember, when you are grieving, cry and let your
feelings out. Don't stuff them to impress others. When you haven't
forgiven someone, you don't need to broadcast that, but be honest with yourself
and at least let others know you are struggling. If you are depressed,
don't go on a guilt trip because of it. When you are afraid of a
diagnosis, let the Body know it. Maybe you think you should not be
afraid. So what is the church for, to help you pretend, to pressure you
into lying, or to help you and encourage you? David said, &quot;When I am
afraid, I will trust in you.&quot; He had no reservations about admitting
he was afraid. It is sad that so many Christians do. By quiet
consent, we play the game called &quot;pretend.&quot; No one says so; it
is an unspoken rule. New believers quickly stumble over it and soon learn
to play along.</p>
<font size="1">
<p></font>But you know, we don't do that too much here at HPC.&nbsp;
I am sure we are not blameless, but we want our church to be a fellowship where
you are encouraged to accept your humanity and that of others. We are
aiming high, but reality is what is, not what ideally should be. And the
only way to move forward is to honestly face where we are. This honest
approach draws some but sadly repels others. Maybe my motivation is
selfish, but I sure love pastoring a church where I can be myself! I hope
that you feel that same freedom!
