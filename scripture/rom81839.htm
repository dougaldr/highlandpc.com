<p><sup>18</sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not 
worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
<sup>19</sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the 
sons of God to be revealed. <sup>20</sup> For the creation was 
subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who 
subjected it, in hope <sup>21</sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its 
bondage to decay and brought into 
the glorious freedom of the children of God. 
<p><sup>22</sup> We know that the whole creation has been 
groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
<sup>23</sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the 
firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as 
sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup>24</sup> For in this 
hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what 
he already has? <sup>25</sup> But if we hope for what we do not 
yet have, we wait for it patiently. </p>
<p><sup>26</sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our 
weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself 
intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup>27</sup> And he who 
searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the 
Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. </p>
<p><sup>28</sup> And we know that in all things God works for 
the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
<sup>29</sup> For those God foreknew he also 
predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the 
firstborn among many brothers. <sup>30</sup> And 
those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those 
he justified, he also glorified.</p> 


<p><sup>31</sup> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us,
who can be against us? <sup>32</sup> He who did not spare his own Son, gut gave
him up for us all&#151;how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all
things? <sup>33</sup> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has
chosen? It is God who justifies. <sup>34</sup> Who is he that condemns?&nbsp;
Christ
Jesus, who died&#151;more than that, who was raised to life&#151;is at the right hand of
God and is also interceding for us. <sup>35</sup> Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness
or danger or sword? <sup>36</sup> As it is written:</p>

<p>&quot;For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to
be slaughtered.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>37</sup> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him
who loved us. <sup>38</sup> For I am convinced that neither death nor life,
neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future nor any powers, <sup>39</sup>
neither height nor depth, for anything else in all creation will be able to
separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus or Lord.</p>
