<br>Doubting Thomas and the Audacious Claim of the Resurrection

<p>Thomas the Apostle was 
certainly a great man of faith, but he was skeptical and cynical by nature. The 
week before Christ was crucified, when opposition to Christ by the leaders was 
becoming intense, Jesus decided to go to Bethany, near Jerusalem, where Jesus&#039; 
enemies were strongest. The disciples were against such a plan, but Jesus was 
determined. He intended to resurrect His dear friend, Lazarus.</p>
<p>What did Thomas do? He 
responded, “Let us also go, that we may die with him” (<b>John 11:16</b>). Thomas was 
a dedicated follower of Jesus. He believed Jesus was the Messiah and was 
willing to risk his life for Him, as you can see in this context. But Jesus 
rising from the dead? Once again, truth was stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>When Thomas doubted the 
resurrection, he was not rejecting Jesus as much as he was rejecting the concept 
that Jesus could resurrect Himself (all three Persons of the Trinity 
participated in the resurrection, including the Son, according to 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/john21822.htm')" target=_self  class=pop>John 2:18-22</a>). 
He could not reconcile how Jesus could be God’s chosen Messiah and 
still God could allow Him to suffer the ignoble death of the cross. He was 
paradigm blind: the Jews knew that the Messiah was going to defeat Israel’s 
enemies and bring in the Golden Age. Thomas did not understand the concept of 
one Messiah but two Comings. All he knew was that He who had worked so many 
miracles could not deliver Himself from the Romans. Thomas was thrown for a 
loop.</p>
<p>Lest you go too hard on 
Thomas, remember the other disciples did not believe in the resurrection (except 
for John) until they themselves saw Jesus. They thought the women were crazy, 
and Thomas thought the other apostles were crazy in the same way. Jesus’ 
followers simply found it difficult to swallow the idea of the resurrection. 
The idea of the resurrection IS a crazy, absurd thought. It just happens to be 
true. That is why Paul says that the Gospel is “foolishness to them that 
perish.” It is an offensive, scandalous message to those whose hearts are hard.
</p>
<p>The previously skeptical 
apostles became so convinced of the truth of the resurrection of Jesus that they 
suffered torture and laid down their lives rather than deny its authenticity. 
They did not espouse the resurrection as a theory: they were convinced, against 
their skeptical natures, that it was a fact. As church history and modern evangelical 
experiences demonstrate, convinced skeptics often become the greatest 
Christians. They become the Josh McDowells and the C.S. Lewises.</p>
<p>We who live in the church 
age have heard about the resurrection of Christ since childhood. The “absurd 
edge” of our belief doesn’t register because we are used to hearing about it. 
But everything in the Christian faith hinges on this one event. If it is 
untrue, Jesus was just an egotistical philosopher who called great attention to 
Himself and made audacious claims. If it is true, Jesus surely is the Son of 
God and the Scriptures are the Word of God. Those who trust Christ will enjoy 
eternity with God in heaven while those who reject Him will enter into “outer 
darkness.” The resurrection is either history’s greatest hoax or history’s 
greatest event. For those of us who believe, we can testify that the 
resurrection, which occurred nearly 2,000 years ago, has changed our lives 
today!</p>
