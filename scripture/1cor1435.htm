<p><sup>3 </sup>But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their
strengthening, encouragement and comfort. <sup>4</sup>He who speaks in a tongue
edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church. <sup>5</sup>I would
like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy.
He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he
interprets, so that the church may be edified.</p>
