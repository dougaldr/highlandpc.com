<p><sup>1</sup> Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being
gathered to him, we ask you, brothers, <sup>2</sup> not to become easily
unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come
from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> Don't
let anyone deceive you in any way for that day will not come until the rebellion
occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.&nbsp;
<sup>4</sup>
He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is
worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple proclaiming himself to be
God.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you
these things?&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> And now you know what is holding him back, so that he
may be revealed at the proper time.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup> For the secret power of
lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue
do do so till he is taken out of the way.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> And then the lawless one
will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth
and destroy by the splendor of his coming.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> The coming of the
lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds
of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders, <sup>10</sup> and in every sort of
evil that deceives those who are perishing.&nbsp; They perish because they refused to
love the truth and so be saved.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup> For this reason God sends them a
powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie <sup>12</sup> and so that
all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in
wickedness.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup> But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the
Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the
sanctifying of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.</p>
