<p>
<b>Marriage 
Ceremony of John Doe and Jane Smith</b></p>
<p>
Please be seated.</p>
<p>
Dearly beloved:</p>
<p>
We are gathered 
together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join 
together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Marriage is commended in 
God’s Word to be honorable among all men: therefore, it is not to be entered 
into lightly but reverently, advisedly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy 
estate, these two persons come now to be joined.</p>
<p>
(to the father of the bride) Who gives this woman to be married to this man?</p>
<p>
(father responds) Her mother and I do.</p>
<p>
Let us pray for
John and Jane (for things 
like new lives together, trials and joys, Lord of lives, empower to keep vows, 
etc.).</p>
<p>
(In preparation of the scripture reading during prayer, 
Fred Jones comes forward to his reading position.)

<p>
<b>Scripture 
Reading</b></p>
<p>
<b>1 Corinthians 13:4-7, 13</b></p>
<blockquote>
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not 
proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it 
keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the 
truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.…And 
now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is 
love.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Genesis 2:18-24</b><i>

</i></p>
<p>

&quot;And the Lord God said, 'It is not good that man should be alone; I will make 
him a help mate.....' Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and 
shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.&quot;</p>
<p>
<b>Proverbs 18:22</b></p>
<p>

&quot;He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 5:31-33 </b></p>
<p>

&quot;As the Scriptures say, 'A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his 
wife, and the two are united into one.' This is a great mystery, but it is 
an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one. So again I say, each 
man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her 
husband.&quot;</p>
<p>
<b>Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</b></p>
<blockquote>
Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one 
falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no 
one to help him up! Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But 
how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend 
themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</blockquote>
<p>(to the 
groom)
John, will you 
have this woman to be your wedded wife, to live together after God’s ordinance 
of matrimony? Will you love her, comfort her, honor and keep her in sickness 
and in health; and, forsaking all others, be faithful to her so long as you both 
shall live? Do you so promise?</p>
<p>
(groom responds) I do.</p>
<p>
(to the bride)
Jane, will you 
have this man to be your wedded husband, to live together after God’s ordinance, 
in the holy estate of matrimony? Will you submit to him and serve him, love, 
honor and keep him in sickness and in health; and forsaking all others, be 
faithful to him as long as you both shall live? Do you so promise?</p>
<p>
(bride responds) I do.</p>

<p>
<b>Sermonette</b></p>
<p>
Paul wrote to the Ephesians in Ephesians 5:25, 
&quot;Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up 
for her.&quot; Although men are to take the lead, both husband and wife are called 
upon to exercise strong love within a marriage and a family. From this simple 
text, we can make a few deductions.</p>
<ol type=I><li><b>
		Christ's Love for Us Is the Prototype for Love in Marriage.</b></p>
<ol type=A><li>The Son of God became a man, lived a sinless 
life, and freely chose to offer His life as a payment for our sins so a Holy God 
could forgive us.</p>
<li>Why? Because of love. Love is sacrificial by 
nature.</p>
<li>
Marital love is not always 
sacrificial: We give and receive; we surrender some of our rights 
and spouse surrenders some of his or her rights.</p>
<li>But the kind of love God demonstrated is on 
standby. Sometimes we give without receiving in return. Sometimes we receive 
without giving in return.</p></ol>
<p><li><b>Love Is a Choice to Take the Initiative.</b>
<ol type=A><li>Jesus chose to give Himself as an atoning 
sacrifice. The only thing we could contribute toward our salvation is the sin 
from which God saves us.
<li>Love is not passive but involves sacrifice 
and risk. Jesus did not feel like dying on the cross. The night before He died 
in Gethsemane, He struggled in prayer. &quot;Let this cup….&quot;</p>
	</p>
	<li>In marriage, that might mean being the first 
to apologize or the only one to apologize. When a conflict makes you and 
your spouse distant, it means being the first to swallow our pride and get over 
who is right and who is wrong.</ol></ol>
	<p>So, John and Jane, when you are confused as to 
what love is, remember the pricetag God paid because of his great love for you, 
and find strength there to love one another through thick and thin, through 
times both good and bad. </p>
	<p>
	<b>Vows</b></p>
	<p>(to the groom) John, 
please, repeat after me. &quot;I, John, take 
thee, Jane, to be my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, 
for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love 
and to cherish, till death do us part, according to God’s holy Word, and to you, 
I pledge my love.&quot;</p>
	<p>(to the 
	bride) Jane, 
please repeat after me. &quot;I, Jane, take 
thee, John, to be my wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, 
for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love, 
cherish, and serve till death do us part, according to God’s holy Word, and to 
you, I pledge my love.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>Ring 
Ceremony</b></p>
	<p>The wedding ring 
is an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible spiritual bond that 
unites two loyal hearts in endless love. As the ring is circular in shape and 
has no beginning or ending, so it is a symbol of love that know no bounds.
</p>
	<p>John, 
do you have a ring to give as a token of your love for Jane?</p>
	<p>(groom 
responds) I do.</p>
	<p>Repeat 
after me. &quot;With this ring, 
I thee wed and pledge my love to you alone.&quot;</p>
	<p>Jane, 
do you have a ring to give as a token of your love for John?</p>
	<p>(bride responds) I do.</p>
	<p>Then repeat 
after me. &quot;With this ring, 
I thee wed and pledge my love to you alone.&quot;</p>
	<p><b>Sand 
Ceremony</b></p>
	<p>Sand is a common 
substance on planet earth as bountiful as the stars in the universe. God 
promised Abraham that He would make his descendants as numerous as the stars of 
heaven and the sands of the sea.</p>
	<p>A container of 
sand holds many grains. So a human being is a multifaceted and complex 
individual with many talents, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. When we 
marry, we join all that we are to another. We combine our lives into one greater 
vessel. </p>
	<p>But God is 
Sovereign and the foundation for a Christian marriage. The white sand in the 
larger flask represents the presence and blessing of God, our sure foundation.</p>
	<p>As the sand in 
these two containers is poured into the third container, the original, 
individual samples of sand no longer exist but are joined together as one. Just 
as these grains of sand can never be separated and poured again into the 
individual containers, so will your lives together as a married couple be 
intertwined as you become one flesh with God as the basis of the relationship.</p>
	<p><b>Congregational Hymn</b></p>
	<p><b>Prayer</b></p>
	<p>Our Great God,</p>
	<p>We thank You for 
Your grace. It is Your grace that saves us. It is Your grace that provides 
strength for daily living, and it is Your grace that blesses with great joys. We 
rejoice in Your ordination of marriage. Thank You for leading John and Jane 
together by Your grace.</p>
	<p>Lord, we are all 
sinners, and when two become one, their unity will always be imperfect because 
we are imperfect. Yet, in Christ, we are a new creation, and Your Spirit is 
transforming us into the character of Christ. </p>
	<p>Help this couple 
to be considerate of one another, to be forgiving, to practice patience day 
after day and year after year, and to confront one another when necessary. Keep 
them far away from sarcasm and contempt. May they express themselves honestly 
and openly. Help them to work as a team, each looking out for the good of the 
other.</p>
	<p>God, unless You 
build the house, they labor in vain who build it. We pray, our gracious Father, 
that You would build this house. </p>
	<p>Accomplish Your 
will in this marriage and glorify Your Name. Help Jane and John to love one 
another as friends, as brother and sister in Christ, and as man and wife. May 
they not forget they are friends. Nurture their friendship, we ask. May they not 
forget they are followers of Jesus Christ. Help them to remember the call to 
build up one another spiritually as brothers and sisters in Christ are meant to 
do. Marriage does not replace friendship nor our place in the Body of Christ.</p>
	<p>As man and wife, 
help this bride and groom to relate to each other as Christ, the groom, does to 
His bride, the Church. The Savior leads but does not coerce. The church follows 
the direction of her Savior. </p>
	<p>Jesus gave His 
life for the church offering Himself as a sacrifice for our sins to the Father. 
In Gethsemane, Jesus did not feel like dying for the church, but He did what was 
in the church's best interest even when that best interest ran contrary to His 
feelings. Help this bride and groom to remember that love means sacrifice.
</p>
	<p>Just as Christ 
rose to newness of life on that first Easter Sunday, so You, O Father, bless and 
exalt those who serve You and follow Your plan.</p>
	<p>And so, Lord, 
John and Jane enter the marriage covenant with faith in You. We pray that You 
would bless and guide them throughout their lives, grant them peace and harmony, 
and we pray that You would help them observe the vows they make today. We ask 
all these things in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
	<p><b>Pronouncement and Kiss</b></p>
	<p>What therefore 
God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
	<p>Forasmuch as 
John and Jane have consented together in holy matrimony, and have witnessed the 
same before God and this company, and have given and pledged their love to each 
other, and have declared the same by giving and receiving rings, I pronounce 
that they are man and wife.</p>
	<p>You may kiss the 
bride.</p>
	<p>Ladies and 
gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs. John Doe.</p>
