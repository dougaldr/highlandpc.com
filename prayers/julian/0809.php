<p>Great King of All,</p>
<p>You are a holy God; You are to be feared. When Moses saw 
the burning bush, he had to remove his sandals, for he was on holy ground. When 
Uzzah tried to steady the Ark of the Covenant with his hand, You smote him. 
When You gave the Law, nothing was allowed to approach the holy mountain. When 
Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit, they dropped dead. You are a holy 
God and woe to them who fail to respect You. Lord, You are to be feared, but I am 
to grow to be more like You, and You are also a social God.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that I too need others to be happy and 
fulfilled. Sometimes I feel lonely and alone; help me not to cower in a corner, 
but help me to jump into my church, neighborhood and community. You made me 
social, just as You are social. Help me nurture that part of my being and not 
stifle it in fear.</p>
<p>Help me remember that our church is a body and that I have 
a part to play. Help me to be forbearing, to confront 
when necessary and not to be touchy. Help me maintain a realistic view about 
human nature—even among the regenerate—so that I do not hold false expectations 
that will be frustrated.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some specific requests to bring before You 
today. They are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray that You would protect my loved ones and I 
throughout our lives. Send guardian angels to watch over us, I pray. Keep us 
from harm and evil of all kinds.</p>
<p>This day I pray for the Pacific nation of the Solomon 
Islands. Thank You that over 34% of the people claim to be born-again 
evangelicals! As the nation tries to get itself together after 20 years of war, 
we pray that the Christians would lead the way and consider the best interests 
of all. Many of the island pastors are not trained adequately and some of 
them have brought disgrace to the Gospel. We pray that You would strengthen the 
pastors, help them seek and find training and help them lead their flocks as 
you would have them led. Bring a new revival to this land, I ask.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, for the ministry of BEE International. &quot;Twenty-five 
years of ministry have uniquely equipped BEE International to 
respond to the historic opportunities throughout the world today. Studies 
indicate that over 90% of the world's theologically trained church leaders live 
in North America and Western Europe. Statistics suggest that 2 million pastors 
outside this area have not had any Bible training at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;BEE International began in the countries of Eastern Europe 
and the former Soviet Union. They continue to work in these countries with 
nationals taking more and more of the responsibility for the ministry. With 
growing needs for training in other parts of the world, [they] are poised to 
expand this type of servant-leadership training.&quot; O Father, help them, provide 
for them, guide them and empower those who minister through BEE so that they 
are completely successful in accomplishing what You have for them. Grant them 
harmony and great fruit, I ask.</p>
<p>Help me to bear fruit for You, I pray in Yeshua’s Name, 
Amen.</p>
