<p>O Lord,</p>
<p>How awesome and majestic You are. You inspire Your 
creation to be awestruck at You. We marvel at You; our mouths hang open and our 
hearts are filled beyond capacity. You are the God Who inspires awe. When I 
gaze into the sky, I am in a sense intimidated. I remember how small I am 
compared to the vast sky above. Then I remember how small planet earth is 
compared to our sun or some of the larger planets in our Solar System. Then I 
remember how small our solar system is compared to our galaxy. And then I 
remember our galaxy is one of perhaps countless galaxies and I am completely 
overwhelmed. And You, Lord, created all this out of nothing. And You, Lord, 
care about me. How can it be? But it is so, because You have said so and You 
have proven it so by sending Your Son as my sin sacrifice.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to be a good steward of the funds with which 
You provide me. <b>Proverbs 17:18</b> reads, &quot;Of what use is money in the hand of a 
fool, since he has no desire to get wisdom.&quot; O, Lord, may I be a wise person. 
Help me be wise in all areas including money management.</p>
<p>Help me to resist temptation and the lures of Satan today. Do not allow me to 
give place to the devil, or to gain him access into my life.</p>
<p>Father, I have some personal health concerns including: __________. I also pray 
for the physical, mental, or spiritual health of others including: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, the European nation of Sweden has a tremendous 
history. The church in Sweden has been extremely missionary minded, well 
beyond its numbers. But nowadays, Lord, only 4.9% of the population claim to be 
born-again evangelicals. The state church has gone the way of theological 
liberalism, no longer believing in the truth of Scripture. In 1900, 99% of the 
population believed that there was a God; now that percentage is less than 
half! O God, revive this nation. May Your Spirit grant many the repentance 
that leads to life. May the evangelical church double over the next decade to 
everyone’s surprise, I ask! Because You are Sovereign, You can easily do this 
and I pray that You would.</p>
<p>Father, thank You for Eagle Projects International, &quot;an 
interdenominational Christian ministry of evangelism, church planting and 
various kinds of humanitarian assistance projects such as medical clinics, 
English camps, orphanages and church training. [They] are always conducting new 
projects in different countries around the world.&quot; Bless this ministry as it 
fits into Your greater plan of world evangelism and missions. May some who get 
involved in these projects sense Your call to full-time missions, I ask.</p>
<p>Today I pray for those who work as correctional officers 
and jailors. Lord, these are difficult tasks within less than perfect systems. 
Help those who are Christians to distinguish themselves with wisdom, street 
smarts and Christlike character, I ask.</p>
<p>May I live in a Christlike manner today, I pray in His 
Name, Amen.</p>
