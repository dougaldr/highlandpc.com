<p><sup>10</sup> For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: &quot;If
a man will not work, he shall not eat.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> We hear that some among you are idle.&nbsp; They are not busy; they
are busybodies.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup> Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus
Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.&nbsp; <sup>13</sup> And as for you,
brothers, never tire of doing what is right.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take
special note of him.&nbsp; Do not associate with him in order that he may feel
ashamed.&nbsp; <sup>15</sup> Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a
brother.</p>
