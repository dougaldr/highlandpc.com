<p><sup>11</sup> But Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she 
wept, she bent over to look into the tomb <sup>12</sup> and saw 
two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the 
other at the foot.</p>   
<p><sup>13</sup> They asked her, “Woman, why are you 
crying?” </p>
<p>“They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don't know where they 
have put him.” <sup>14</sup> At this, she turned around and saw 
Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. </p>
<p><sup>15</sup> “Woman,” he said, “why are you crying? Who 
is it you are looking for?” </p>
<p>Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him 
away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.” </p>
<p><sup>16</sup> Jesus said to her, “Mary.” </p>
<p>She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means 
Teacher). </p>
<p><sup>17</sup> Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I 
have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I 
am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” </p>
