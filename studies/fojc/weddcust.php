<br>John 14 and Ancient Wedding Customs

<p>In John 14, Jesus talks about going away to prepare a place 
for believers. He then says that He will come back and receive us to Himself. 
This terminology clearly refers to the Jewish wedding customs of His day.</p>
<p>In first century, marriages were arranged between 
parents—but with the permission of the perspective bride. If a marriage was 
arranged and the couple was officially betrothed (engaged), the man would soon 
leave for his father’s house. Over the next year, he would build an annex 
(attached to the father's house) for he and his bride.</p>
<p>The bride and her attendants (the virgins of the “10 
Virgins” parable, for example) never knew exactly when the groom would arrive to 
sweep up his bride and take her to the wedding feast (which would be held at his 
father’s house, perhaps even in a different town). Since they did not know “the 
day nor the hour,” they had to be ready! The groomsmen would precede the groom 
and make the announcement to the bride and her bridal party, “Behold, the groom 
is coming!” They would hurriedly pack and prepare themselves. </p>
<p>Soon the groom would arrive and whisk his bride away to the 
wedding feast. During the feast, the marriage would be consummated in the annex 
room, which the groom had built.</p>
<p>You can see how this imagery is used in <b>John 14</b>. Jesus is 
the groom; the church is His bride. He leaves for an indefinite period of time, 
coming to surprise His bride one day, so she had better be ready. He is busy at 
work right now “preparing a place for us” (a place, not a mansion; accurate 
translations have ruined many a song!—sorry). This place is an annex added 
to “His father’s home.” By the way, if you have your heart set on a “mansion” 
in glory, remember that we are talking figures of speech here. If you look at 
the description of heaven in <b>Revelation 22</b>, it makes a mansion look like kid’s 
stuff. Take it from me: you won’t be let down!</p>
<p>The return of which Jesus speaks is what we call the “Rapture,” an event yet 
future when the “dead in Christ” will rise, and living believers will be “caught 
up together with them to meet the Lord in the air” (see <b>1 Thessalonians 4:13ff</b> 
and <b>1 Corinthians 15:51ff</b> for more details). We will then 
participate in &quot;the Marriage Supper of the Lamb,&quot; (the figurative &quot;consummation&quot; 
period) after which we will return with Christ to help Him rule during the 
Millennium. Although our souls do meet Him at death (<b>2 Corinthians 5</b>), the 
“consummation of the wedding” (&quot;Marriage Supper&quot;) will take place when the 
entire Body of Christ is present in heaven.</p>
