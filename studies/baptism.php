<ol type=1><li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn1">Introduction, Approach, and Principles</a></p>
<p>As I address the issue 
of the relationship of baptism to salvation and the broader issue (that 
salvation is by God's sovereign grace), I want to be up front about where I am 
coming from in several areas. </p>
<p><b><a name="sctn11">My Attitude Toward Folks in Churches of 
Christ/Christian Churches</a></b></p>
<p>First of all, I think 
that <u>many</u> who belong to "Christian" Churches or the Church of Christ know 
and love the Lord. I think there are significant numbers of true believers 
within these ranks, even in the stricter Church of Christ, and I anticipate 
enjoying heaven with them. However, to be frank, I do think that a number of 
folks within those ranks have a false hope of salvation precisely because their 
mixed message encourages them to trust in good works and acts of obedience to 
make them right with God. Nonetheless, others are trusting in the merits of 
Jesus Christ and not merely acknowledging His work on Calvary, but depending 
upon it. This is sometimes <i>in spite</i> of what they are taught, not because 
of it. I do want to be clear on this as well: some Christian Church pastors 
agree with me in the realm of salvation by faith alone apart from baptism. They 
might have a conviction that weekly communion is God's will or that baptism 
should occur on the spot, but those are minor differences. So in the rest of 
this paper, when I refer to "Christian" churches, I am referring to those 
churches holding the view that baptism is necessary for salvation.</p>
<p>To be fair, we must 
admit that there are also very likely many lost people (who have a false 
confidence regarding their salvation) within the confines of conservative 
evangelicalism -- but often not because they are taught incorrectly. I believe 
tares are mixed with the wheat in even the best congregations. Those who 
embrace Jesus as Savior (the one who has provided salvation for us) are truly 
saved, as I see it; in my view, others (who merely acknowledge the atonement 
and give assent to the salvation Christ provided but focus upon their baptism, 
communion, and good works) are like the Jews of old in <b>Romans 10:2-3</b>: "For I 
can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not 
based on knowledge. Since <b><i>they did not know the righteousness that comes 
from God and <u>sought to establish their own</u></i></b>, <b><u>they did not 
submit to God's righteousness</u></b>."</p>
<p>This problem of making 
oneself out to be his own savior is common, unfortunately, even within 
evangelical churches preaching salvation by grace through faith. In such cases, 
preachers preach grace, but many folks still hear "works." But when additional 
conditions and works are added as grounds for salvation, the problem escalates. 
Obviously those who believe in the necessity of baptism for salvation would see 
things differently! So rather than try to conceal my opinion, I am expressing 
it upfront.</p>
<p>The branch of the 
Campbellite family called, "The Disciples of Christ", is not addressed in this 
discussion, since that denomination is predominantly liberal and does consider 
itself bound by and accountable to the Scriptures (understood in their intended 
sense); I view them as any other liberal mainline denomination.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn12">My Theological Conclusions</a></b></p>
<p>I would also like to 
also be <b>upfront</b> regarding my theological perspective. Like many on the 
other side of this issue, I <b><u>seek</u></b> to be Biblical. I am not out to 
follow any man-made system. My conclusions about what the Bible teaches 
(regarding salvation) include unconditional election (you'll read more about 
this below) and perseverance of the true believer (eternal security, though I 
prefer the first term). This closely parallels 80% of the conclusions drawn by 
Calvinists (I recognize four out of five of the "Points of Calvinism," but I 
certainly am not into following Calvin; I just happen to think he and his 
followers have drawn proper conclusions from studying the Scriptures – well, at 
least 80% of the time). </p>
<p><b><a name="sctn13">Terms Defined</a></b></p>
<p>Because of my 
assumption that readers will be driven to find out what the Bible actually 
teaches, I will save space in presenting my Biblical arguments by defining 
terminology. That is the purpose for using terminology in the first place. 
Even the word "Bible" is an extra-scriptural term that saves us from saying a 
mouthful: "the 66 book division of Scripture, including the 39 books of the 
Hebrew Scripture and the 27 books of the Christian Scriptures." Instead, we 
just say, "Bible." </p>
<p>Those who have 
concluded that the doctrine of election is unscriptural and hold the conviction 
that believers can lose their salvation will be referred to in this paper as 
Arminian. That does not mean they follow all the teachings of Arminius, just 
that they happen to agree with Arminius on those points. I will employ the same 
logic for the opposite term Calvinistic. It becomes rude and arrogant in such a 
discussion to say, "I am not a ---, I just believe the Bible" when both sides 
lay claim to a true alignment with Scripture. Let us all assume in this 
discussion that we want the teaching of the Bible to be the final authority.</p>
<p>Another term I need to 
define refers to those who follow the doctrinal perspective common in the 
Church(es) of Christ and Christian Churches, namely that one is not saved until 
he repents, believes, AND is baptized (and sometimes other conditions are added 
as well). The term referring for this belief system incorporates the name of 
the founder of that movement, Campbellism. By using this term, I do not believe 
that folks in these churches follow the teachings of Campbell blindly as Mormons 
do Joseph Smith, for example. The term "Campbellism" or "Campbellite" are used 
to refer to those who agree that the Bible's teachings and what Campbell taught 
about the relationship of baptism to salvation are in agreement. </p>
<p><b><a name="sctn14">Assumption of Integrity</a></b></p>
<p>I hold a view of 
baptism similar to most Baptists (unlike Calvin, who practiced infant 
sprinkling). However, I hold these viewpoints not because I have an agenda to 
align myself with Calvinists or Baptists, but <u>because I have concluded this 
is what the Scriptures teach</u>. There are very few conclusions we might come 
to about the Bible's teaching that someone else has not already concluded (be 
they accurate or inaccurate).</p>
<p>I will also say upfront 
that there are verses, when, taken by themselves, do <i>seem </i>to teach that 
baptism is necessary for salvation. Those who hold the Campbellite view <i>are 
not stupid</i>, nor are they necessarily any more stubborn than conservative 
evangelicals (both groups excel in this area!). If we only had the verses that 
Church of Christ folks camp on (such as 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/acts238.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 2:38</a>), 
I could conclude what they 
have concluded. Although other conclusions are possible even when those verses 
are isolated, the Campbellite conclusions certainly seem a viable option.
</p>
<p>My contention is that 
looking at the broader teaching of Scripture persuades us to select differing 
conclusions than do the Campbellites. But this is not an unusual situation: 
many verses in Scripture taken in isolation could be disastrous (plucking out an 
eye, the example of Jephthah sacrificing his daughter, Abraham marrying his half 
sister, etc.). Although I disagree with some of the Campbellite views, please 
understand this: I do not view them as I would Jehovah Witnesses, Mormons, or 
the cults. I do think they err significantly, and that some of their errors 
distort salvation by grace through faith; their beliefs also result in an 
exclusivist mentality that isolates them from the evangelical community; this 
limits the blessings (and challenges required to hone truth) that come from 
experiencing the broader Body of Christ. </p>
<p><b><a name="sctn15">An Assumption of Goodwill</a></b></p>
<p>So, for purposes of 
simplicity and clarity, <i><u>I will assume that readers of my viewpoint and 
readers who differ are both driven to be true to the teaching of God's Word</u></i><u>.</u> 
That is why, for example, I will take the pains to enumerate and provide vast 
amounts of (taken in-context) Scriptural quotations. <i>Readers are encouraged 
to examine the contexts themselves</i>; my personal attempts at sincerity are no 
guarantee that I am correct. I could be sincere, but still sincerely wrong. I 
recognize I am not the ultimate interpreter, and, frankly, some of my 
interpretations somewhere must be wrong (since no two Christians agree on every 
detail in every area). It is up to the reader to discern my batting average in 
the case before us.</p>
<p>So what I am presenting 
is my UNDERSTANDING of what the Scriptures teach. The Scriptures are 
infallible, but our interpretations are not. We can try to enter into the 
culture and mindset of the human authors and audiences, and we can try to 
interpret objectively and without preexisting agendas. But if we are serious 
about humility, we have to admit that none of us are the ultimate in 
objectivity; we can only, with God's help, try to keep ourselves in check.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn16">Is the Belief That Baptism Is Not Necessary for 
Salvation Tied Directly to a Calvinistic Model?</a></b></p>
<p>Contrary to what some 
theologians from the Churches of Christ and Christian Churches have written, <b>
most evangelicals (by far) do not believe in the doctrine of unconditional 
election</b> (that God chooses people for salvation apart from anything they do) 
although more (but still a minority) do believe in eternal security (once saved, 
always saved<i>). I am among the minority of evangelicals who believe both of 
the above.</i> </p>
<p>Most evangelicals, then 
(like the Assemblies of God, most independent Charismatic churches, Wesleyans, 
Nazarenes, Free Methodist, those conservatives within mainline Protestantism, 
those evangelicals who have chosen to remain within Catholicism, and even 
significant minorities of Baptist and Brethren groups) reject eternal security, 
yet almost all of the above do NOT believe one must be baptized to be saved.</p>
<p>Most believe that baptism is not an option for the Christian, but 
that it is separate from (though associated with) salvation. For the sake of 
simplicity, I will leave out the various views held by evangelicals who believe 
in infant sprinkling (not to insult them, but merely to limit this work), as 
well as views held by liberal mainline Protestants (I don't mind insulting 
them!).</p>
<p>So the belief that one 
is saved upon belief, before being immersed, is the common belief of most 
evangelicals, those who believe in election and those who reject unconditional 
election. Nonetheless, if one believes in election, the issue itself loses 
force, as I will hope to convince you below.</p>
<p>In this paper, I will 
not argue much about mode or timing of baptism. I am assuming that readers 
recognize that I am addressing believer's baptism by immersion after a 
profession of faith in Jesus Christ. The baptismal candidate recognizes that 
Jesus is God in the flesh, Who bled and died for our sins and then arose a 
conqueror. I happen to agree with Campbellism on the idea that baptism is for 
believers only after a profession of faith. </p>
<p>If I fail to persuade 
you to my viewpoint, I at least hope to persuade you that those of us who 
believe in salvation by grace through faith (and baptism as a non-optional 
ritual following but separate from salvation) have some scripturally reasonable 
arguments, even if you reject our viewpoint. </p>
<p>I do not believe 
baptism is an optional matter, but is a mandatory command. As a matter of fact, 
I would never join a church that did not exclusively practice believer's baptism 
by immersion. But I do not believe baptism is crucial to salvation. (I believe 
that my born-again Presbyterian or Reformed friends are saved, even though they 
disagree with me about mode and manner of baptism). Baptism is a matter of 
obedience.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn17">Interpretational Approach</a></b></p>
<p><b><a name="sctn18">The Two Goals of Interpretation</a></b></p>
<p>To my way of thinking, 
there are <b><u>two goals in interpretation</u></b> (as opposed to application), 
and they may be summarized in the form of two questions:</p>
<ol type=1><li><p><b><u>What was the 
original thought of the author?</u></b>
In some Scripture, God dictated His Word. In other portions, the Scripture is 
BOTH the Word of God and the Word of Man. Paul, for example, knew just what he 
meant when he wrote Romans. We should therefore try to enter into his thinking.</p>
<li><p><b><u>How would the 
original recipients (or audience) have understood what was written or said?</u></b>
Too many Christians ask, "What does this mean to me?" before they ask, "How 
would the Roman believers have understood this?" The Bible is the Word of God, 
a verbally inspired and inerrant book, but it is not a magical book. The words 
express thoughts, and we must get at those thoughts. Attention to grammar and 
to the cultural background of the original recipients provides meaningful clues 
to the meaning of a text.</p>
<p><u>I also embrace the 
conviction that Biblical Christianity was best understood by the early church, 
composed of Messianic Jews</u> (see
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/acts2120.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 21:20</a>).<b><i>
When the majority of the church became 
gentile </i></b>(the halfway point 
was reached in about 75A.D.), <b><i>the Jewish assumptions of the New Testament 
were not as well understood and soon lost.</i></b> This is why the church of 
the second and third centuries took such sharp turns away from Biblical teaching 
and objective interpretation. Beliefs deteriorated -- (as I see it) into infant 
sprinkling, one central leader, etc. -- almost immediately after the apostles 
were off the scene.</p></ol>
<p><b><a name="sctn19">Four Interpretational 
Judgment Calls That Come Into Play</a></b></p>
<ol type=1><li><p><b>Is a statement a partial truth or a whole, complete 
truth?</b></p>
<p>"All women are human, therefore all humans are women." 
Saying "all women are human" does not mean there are not other categories of 
human (in this instance, men). This is perhaps the most common interpretational 
(and logical) error made.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Jesus statement in 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john146.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 14:6</a> 
about being THE way, and no one coming to the Father but by Him is so worded that it 
is a complete truth. He cannot be "a" way because He is "the" way, and He makes 
clear that there are no exceptions.</p>
<li><p><b>Does a group of things connected together mean all 
elements of that grouping contribute equally (or at least partially) to the 
result stated?</b></p>
<p>Take Jonah 4:11, "But Nineveh has more than a hundred and 
twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and 
many cattle as well. Should I not be concerned about that great city?&quot; Just because God mentioned cattle here does not mean that 
his compassion for the city was as greatly affected by the number of cattle as 
it does the number of men. As a matter of fact, we might presume that God would 
have still had compassion upon Nineveh if they had no cattle.</p>
<p>At the tomb of Jesus, Mark tells us that an angel said, "He 
is not here…" Matthew tells us there were two angels at the tomb. Both are 
true. In this instance, Matthew gives us the fuller truth, Mark simply wants to 
let us know who is doing the talking (an angel). He does not address the issue 
of how many angels were present. The second angel was present, but did not 
contribute to the conversation, so Mark was not inaccurate by leaving him out of 
his narrative; Matthews's inclusion does not mean that both angels spoke.</p>
<p>I would suggest that some of the small number of verses 
that seem to imply baptism is necessary for salvation should be included under 
this category.</p>
<li><p><b>Do two seeming realities that seem to preclude one 
another force a choice between one or the other, or can they both be true, even 
though it is beyond our ability to reconcile them with our level of information 
and understanding?</b></p>
<p>A bumble bee, according to the laws of physics, cannot 
fly. So does the bumble bee really not fly, or are the laws of physics wrong? 
Or do we accept them both, believing they are somehow reconcilable, even though 
we seem incapable of making that reconciliation?</p>
<p>God is one being, yet He is Three Persons. So is His 
oneness really incorrect, or are His three personalities really not distinct and 
separate? Or do we accept them both, believing they are somehow reconcilable, 
even though we seem incapable of making that reconciliation?</p>
<p>Jesus is fully human. Jesus is fully God. Do we say Jesus 
was just a phantom, or do we deny His deity? Or do we accept them both, 
believing they are somehow reconcilable, even though we seem incapable of making 
that reconciliation?</p>
<p>Much of the Bible was written by men, using their own 
vocabulary and styles (except for the parts dictated), yet it is the Word of 
God. So is the Bible the Word of God but not the word of man, or is it the word 
of man but not the Word of God? Or do we accept them both, believing they are 
somehow reconcilable, even though we seem incapable of making that 
reconciliation? The Bible offers many such paradoxes and antimonies.</p>
<p>Some can be easily reconciled. The Scriptures are clear 
that no man has seen God, yet we read of Moses, Isaiah, and Ezekiel seeing God 
(among others). The reconciliation in that case is simply that no one has seen 
God in His pure, unmasked form. They have, instead, seen visual representations 
of God.</p>
<p>One real issue between those who believe baptism (and any 
number of other potential requirements in addition to faith and repentance) is 
necessary for salvation and those who do not relates to this question: Is it a 
number one situation or a number two judgment call? <b><u>Do we collect all 
potential contributors to salvation and create a master list, or are the 
Scriptures so repetitively clear that we understand these other numerous items 
to be merely the evident fruits of regeneration?</u></b></p>
<li><p><b>Do I distinguish between what was commanded and what 
was done?</b></p>
<p><i>To my knowledge, there is no clear cut verse that says 
we are to follow all the practices of the early church</i>. This should not be 
automatically assumed. We are commanded to observe the traditions Paul taught 
(as revealed and commanded in the epistles).</p>
<p>For example, the early church generally conducted their 
services in Greek, both the men and women wore robes, folks greeted one another 
with a holy kiss, and the men and women sat in segregated sections of the home 
in which they gathered. They did not own church buildings, nor did their 
leaders attend Bible College or seminary. Are we obligated to follow their 
pattern?</p>
<p>We must therefore make careful distinctions between what 
the early church <i>did</i> and what we are <i>commanded to do</i>. Much of 
what they did, we are likewise commanded to do, but <i>not necessarily in the 
same way</i> (e.g., there is no command to my knowledge that says we must have a 
love feast meal before celebrating the Lord's Supper, but that does seem to be 
the example of the early church based on <b>1 Corinthians 11</b>; we are nowhere 
commanded to observe the Lord's Supper every week, though the early church 
seemed to do so on a sometimes daily basis, we are not commanded to have all 
things in common and sell all we have and give our means to the church leaders, 
etc). </p>
<p>These four judgment calls must be made intelligently, 
prayerfully, and <b>consistently</b>.</p></ol>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn2">Necessary for What?</a></p>
<p>You can tell what one's 
priorities are by how one understands incomplete questions. Like ink blotches in 
a psychiatrist's office, these questions reveal what is on our minds.</p>
<p>Most often, when I hear 
someone ask, "Is baptism necessary?" I have learned to interpret it as, "Is 
baptism necessary to salvation?" The question is generally asked by folks who 
DO believe baptism is necessary to salvation, and it reveals that they are 
focused upon "making it to heaven."</p>
<p>On the other hand, 
those of us who believe that baptism is NOT necessary to salvation want to hear 
the question as, "Is baptism necessary to please God and grow in ones walk with 
Him?" The answer to that question is, "Of course it is.&quot;</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn21">Differing Concerns</a></b></p>
<p>The way the question is 
initially heard advertises the differing emphases between these two camps. One 
is mainly concerned about "making it to heaven," the other feels secure and 
(ideally) is concerned with pressing on toward spiritual maturity. Sadly, there 
are people in both camps who are not much concerned about anything doctrinal!</p>
<p>The believer who 
understands that salvation is an unearned gift, not a probationary loan, can 
more logically focus on serving his Lord and building up the kingdom; he might 
be concerned about losing his rewards (being saved "so as by fire"), but eternal 
life is not in the balance; the believer who considers himself just a step away 
from damnation and whose destiny hangs in the balance moment by moment is more 
obsessed with what he <i>doesn't</i> do. His concern is making the grade and 
not losing eternal life at the last moment.</p>
<p>The result is two very 
differing forms of Christianity. The issue is much broader than, "Is baptism 
necessary for salvation?" The matter addresses this question: Is salvation a 
joint effort between man and God or is it totally of God? (Theologically, this 
contrast is between monergism –one, namely God, doing all the work, and 
synergism – a cooperative joint effort; I am obviously a monergist). Is Jesus 
Christ the Savior, or are we partly our own saviors? Is He a half or even 90 
percent savior? Or is He 100 percent Savior—He completely does ALL (in the 
fullest sense of the word) the saving?</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn22">Two Conflicting Viewpoints: Faith Alone or Not?</a></b></p>
<p>Within Bible-believing 
Christianity, we find many differing opinions in a multitude of arenas. There 
is nothing I believe that someone else, also claiming to be a Christian, denies. 
And that is true for each of us. Although descriptions vary, most definitions of 
what it means to be an evangelical Christian include the belief in salvation by 
grace through faith apart from works.</p>
<p>Yet within this broader 
category, there are numerous views as to what a "work" is. Most of us would 
include in this category rituals (such as baptism, fasting, communion, church 
membership). Others argue, "Those are not works – they are 'means of grace.'"</p>
<p>Works, we are told, are 
things like helping the little old lady across the street (even if she doesn't 
want to go?) or visiting a shut-in. Yet the Bible makes no distinction between 
rituals and good works. Works are put in contrast consistently with being saved 
by grace through faith. Grace means God's undeserved, unmerited favor.</p>
<p>Very few (if any) of 
those I have met who believe one has to accept Christ (repentance and faith) AND 
be baptized in order to be saved stop there. They invariably include additional 
works as necessary for salvation (in contrast to merely evidencing salvation). 
So we are ultimately addressing a much broader issue: is salvation by God's 
undeserved favor – graciously given to him "who works not," or is it a 
multi-step (you're on probation) "trial size" salvation? Is it "shareware" 
that expires after the thirty day trial unless you pay for it, or is it truly 
and completely free?</p>
<p>This contrast between 
grace and works -- something we earn and something we receive freely -- is made 
clear for us in <b>Romans 4:4-5</b>. Paul elaborates upon this theme (talking about 
God graciously choosing some Jews for salvation) further in <b>Romans 11:5-6</b>, "So too, at the 
present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. <b><u>And if by grace, then it 
is no longer by works</u></b>; <i>if it were, grace would no longer be grace</i>.&quot;
</p>
<p>Logically, everything 
must be divided into one of these two categories. Since grace comes solely from 
God, <b><u>everything else</u></b> MUST be a work. There are no 
third choices allowed in Paul's contrast. As <b>Romans 4:4-5</b> puts it: "Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as 
a gift, but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not work but trusts 
God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness."</p>
<p>Note here that God 
justifies (credits as righteous) the "wicked." They are still "wicked" when 
they are justified. It doesn't say God justifies the "formerly wicked." If 
they cleaned up their own act, that would be a work, a wage – not an unmerited 
favor. </p>
<p><b>Romans 3:21-27</b> tell us 
that God provided a gracious payment for our sin through the death of Jesus 
Christ. This is how a God Who is holy, righteous, and just can freely forgive; 
through His Son, He Himself paid the penalty.</p>
<blockquote><sup>21</sup> But now righteousness <b><u>from God</u></b>, apart from 
law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. <sup>22</sup>
	<u><b>This 
righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all 
who believe</b></u>. There is no difference, <sup>23</sup> for all have sinned and fall short 
of the glory of God, <sup>24</sup> and are justified <b><u>freely by his grace</u></b> through 
the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. <sup>25</sup> God presented him as <b><u>a 
sacrifice of atonement</u></b>, through faith in his blood. He did this to 
demonstrate his <b> <u>justice</u></b>, because in his forbearance he had left the sins 
committed beforehand unpunished-- <sup>26</sup> he did it to demonstrate his justice at the 
present time, <b><u>so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have 
faith in Jesus. </u></b><sup>27</sup> <b><u><i>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded.</i></u></b> On what 
principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith.</blockquote>
<p>Salvation by grace 
through faith involves nothing of which we could boast about. <i>If we can take 
even a slight credit for our salvation, we have left the realm of complete 
grace.</i> If we take credit for anything we do – even believing – we have a 
basis for boasting about making the right choice. I would like to add this: if 
we take credit for choosing to be baptized and thus saved, we have contributed 
something, albeit something relatively minor, to the salvation process. The 
righteous we receive comes from God <u>completely</u>, not from within 
ourselves. Although God does help us to become righteous in character, the 
righteousness being spoken of here is bestowed upon us from God Himself. In the 
words of the KJV, this is what we call "imputed" righteousness (see also 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/2cor521.htm')" target=_self class=pop>2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).</p>
<p>Coupled with the idea 
that baptism is necessary for salvation is a firm Arminianism which stresses 
human responsibility to the exclusion of a Sovereign and Immutable God who 
needs no one </span>(<b>Acts 17:25</b>, "And he is not served by human hands, as if he 
needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything 
else..."). See <a href="#appendix2" class="reg">Appendices below</a> regarding God's immutability.</p>
<p>Although it may seem 
that the heart of the debate revolves around a few passages in Acts, it really 
centers upon the very nature of God Himself (and the nature of fallen man). 
God's attributes, especially His immutability and sovereignty, are perhaps the 
core issues. I shall address some of these issues later in this study.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn23">A Deductive Check</a></b></p>
<p>In math class, I was 
taught to "check" a problem by reversing it. In other words, you check a 
subtraction problem by adding the difference, etc. The same is true in Biblical 
interpretation. If our viewpoint is correct, we should see it displayed or 
lived out in Scripture.</p>
<p>Please note this 
important logical inference: if one is teaching salvation as Paul taught it, the 
same question should arise, the one they asked Paul. It is: "Shall we sin that 
grace may abound?" (<b>Romans 6:1</b>). <b><u>If this question would not 
logically come to mind with your presentation of salvation, then you are not 
proclaiming the same message that Paul proclaimed.</u></b> <i>If we preach the message Paul 
preached, this question should arise.</i></p>
<p>An Arminian or works 
Gospel would not raise the question. The obvious answer to "Shall we sin that 
grace might abound" would be, "No, for we would lose our salvation." But that 
is not the answer Paul gives. An Arminian presentation would never provoke that 
question. But if someone taught that we were saved freely by grace through 
faith in Christ, and that we were foreordained to believe and therefore secure, 
the question of why we should avoid sin WOULD arise<i>. This is a very logical 
argument, and I urge my readers to ponder this one deeply</i>. Please think 
about this. This argument itself should cause an Arminian to reassess his 
views.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn24">The Implications of That Conflict</a></b></p>
<p>The implications of 
this difference of opinion vary with the Campbellite, since there are variations 
from extreme "you have to be baptized to be saved/non-instrumental Campbellism" 
to an approximation of the evangelical view that one is saved by faith alone 
espoused by a minority of the Christian churches.</p>
<p>Some teach that even 
believing in Christ and being baptized upon profession by immersion is not 
enough; they require candidates to be baptized under their auspices. Others 
recognize any believer's immersion as adequate, while others are unsure whether 
baptism is or is not necessary for salvation. Some independent "Christian" 
ministers even agree with my position and identify with the evangelical 
mainstream. </p>
<p>Some would say that a 
person who has believed in Christ and been immersed upon his profession of faith 
is still lost if not indoctrinated with Campbellite viewpoints and is not 
genuinely born again. Others would say he is a brother in the Lord. Most would 
say that a Presbyterian or Reformed or Methodist believer (like Jonathan Edwards 
or Wesley) who has professed Christ is unsaved because he has never been 
baptized by immersion as a believer.</p>
<p>The same perspectives 
are reciprocated. Many evangelicals doubt the salvation of someone embracing 
Campbellite theology because he is not trusting Christ as the sole basis of his 
salvation, but shares that trust with baptism and/or other good works. They 
would apply the principle from <b>Galatians 5:4</b>, </span>"You who are trying to be 
justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from 
grace."</p>
<p>So people on both sides 
of the argument accuse their opponents of being unregenerate and preaching a 
false gospel, thus labeling their opponents as false teachers. Certainly both 
schools cannot be right; someone is (or both are) wrong somewhere. </p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn3">Viewed from the Viewpoint of a Sovereign God Who 
Provides Sovereign Grace: Prove Election and Baptism is Placed in Perspective</a></p>
<p>As I see it, a correct 
view of the Sovereignty of God and of unconditional election destroys many false 
plans of salvation and clarifies how gracious (completely and totally unmerited) 
grace really is. Of course, not everyone agrees that my understanding of 
Scripture is correct! I respond to such folks with tongue in cheek: "Nobdody's 
perfect." </p>
<p>I must admit that I am 
convinced that the Scriptures teach that God is Sovereign and that salvation is 
totally -- not just mostly -- of God.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn31">Unconditional Election Guarantees That WHATEVER the 
Requirements Are for Salvation, They Will Be Fully Met for the Elect.</a></b></p>
<p>Like God zapping Saul 
on the Road to Damascus (how much of a choice did he have?), the turning of the 
Jews to the Messiah at the end of the Tribulation 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/zech1212.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Zechariah 12:1-2</a>), 
or his saving and sealing the 144,000 Jews during the Tribulation, God is not at the 
mercy of human fickleness, but draws His elect to Himself irresistibly. At 
least, that's how I see it. He does the converting -- completely. He coaxes us 
along to faith. Paul, who said his conversion was to serve as an example 
(<b>1 Timothy 1:16</b>), did not have too much of a choice. "But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, 
the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience <u> <b>
as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life</b></u>.&quot;</p>
<p>Although man exercises 
faith, God creates that faith and coaxes the elect to salvation. The "zap" may 
not be as impressive as the zap Paul received, but it is a zapping nonetheless. 
Enough chatter. Here are the verses!</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn32">A Crash Course in Sovereign Grace</a></b></p>
<p>The doctrine of 
election and the idea of God's sovereign grace are deep subjects. Many Bible 
scholars have written books about this meaty matter, and the theme itself raises 
many questions (most of them are quite easy to answer, though we do not always 
like the answers).</p>
<p>What I hope to prove is 
this: God has chosen individuals for salvation apart from anything good in 
them. All those whom God has chosen (elected) will be saved; those He has not 
chosen will be lost. Whatever is necessary for salvation (in my view, 
repentance and faith in Christ), the elect will attain – no if, ands, or buts.</p>
<p>Let's lay our 
foundation. If God did not elect certain individuals, no one would choose Him. 
<b>Romans 3:10-11</b> reads, "As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even 
one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.'" </p>
<p><a name="romcor">In Romans</a>, Paul argued 
that when society had knowledge of God, they abandoned the knowledge of the true 
God and created their own gods. <b>Romans 3:11</b> does not say, "no one seeks after a 
god;" the issue is seeking the true God. The true God is not appealing to the 
natural man.</p>
<p><b>Romans 8:7</b> continues 
along this theme: "the sinful mind is hostile to God." Again, the God being 
spoken of here is not just any god, but the true God. The sinful mind is not 
necessarily hostile to a false god. The sinful mind is especially hostile 
toward a God Who sovereignly elects some to salvation while passing over others, 
as is implied below. People do not like this kind of God. </p>
<p>Since, "<b><u>the man without the Spirit does not accept the 
things that come from the Spirit of God</u></b>, for they are foolishness to 
him, and <b><u>he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned</u></b>&quot; 
(<b>1 Corinthians 2:14</b>), it takes a miraculous 
work of the Spirit for a man to accept the things that come from the Spirit of 
God and to understand them. Through the Holy Spirit, God overcomes man's lack 
of desire for the true God, man's hostility toward the true God, and man's 
refusal to accept the things that come from the Spirit of God.</p>
<p><b><a name="eph2">Ephesians 2:1-10</a></b> 
presents the sequence of this work. I will indent the Scripture verses with my comments 
presented between the 
verses:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>1</sup> As for you, you were <b>dead</b> in your 
transgressions and sins, </p>
<p><sup>2</sup> in which you used to live when you followed the ways 
of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now 
at work in those who are disobedient. </p>
<p><sup>3</sup> All of us also lived among them at one time, 
gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and 
thoughts. Like the rest, <b>we were by nature</b> objects of wrath.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that all of us were at 
one time, "objects of wrath." We were dead in our transgressions. Dead men 
don't believe. They just stay dead. So it takes a miracle – a spiritual 
resurrection we call the New Birth or regeneration to bring us to life so that 
we can believe.</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>4</sup> But because of his great love for us, <b>God</b>, who 
is rich in mercy, </p>
<p><sup>5</sup> <b>made us alive</b> with Christ even <b>when we were 
dead</b> in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that God made us 
alive; it wasn't some joint effort we and God did, nor something other 
Christians did – God Himself brings us to life, even though we were dead. This 
is done not because we somehow deserve it (it is not a reward or earned), but by 
grace (favor) precisely because we deserve none of it.</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>6</sup> <b>And God raised us up</b> with Christ <b>and seated 
us with him</b> in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> in order that in the coming ages he might show the 
incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ 
Jesus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once we are brought to 
life, we have a position in heaven with Christ already, and we are enrolled in 
His eternal school, the school of learning about His incomparable grace forever. 
Although we remain on earth for a time, our legal position is in heaven. Also 
worth noting is this: if we have free will now (and I do not believe we ever 
have a truly free will, I prefer responsibility), then it cannot be that 
important because we will not have free will once we are in heaven (unless you 
believe we can lose our salvation after we are already in heaven). Since we are 
already legally and positionally in heaven, seated with Christ, an Arminian 
viewpoint could logically be pressed to logically conclude that we could lose 
our salvation a million years into eternity OR that our free will is not 
absolutely necessary for our soul's health and we will lose it in glory. </span>
</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>8</sup> For it is <b>by grace</b> <i>you have been</i> saved,
<b>through faith</b>--and <b>this</b> not from yourselves<b>, it is the gift of 
God</b>-- </p>
<p><sup>9</sup> <b>not by works</b>, so that <b>no one can boast</b>.</p></blockquote>
<p><u>The whole process of 
salvation</u>: God's grace that saves us 
and even the faith we <u>exercise is not from ourselves </u>(the term "this" or 
"that" is neuter in the Greek, referring neither to only grace nor faith, but 
the whole process of salvation, all of <b>Ephesians 2:1-10</b><u>)</u>. Even the faith 
with which we believe comes from God as a free gift. We are brought to life 
apart from anything we do. The evidence of this spiritual resurrection, this 
regeneration is that we exercise the faith God gives us and we become 
believers. We are brought to spiritual life first, and then we believe. 
Although this occurs in a split second, spiritual life comes first, and then our 
belief follows. Only a spiritually alive person, brought to life by the Spirit, 
can believe (see the verses mentioned above from <a href="#romcor" class="reg">Romans and Corinthians</a>).</p>
<p>It is also worth noting 
that the phrase, "you have been saved" is the perfect tense, meaning <u>the 
event has already occurred and carries with it a current result</u>, "you have 
been and now stand saved." Although some aspects of our salvation are yet 
future ("the redemption of our body" in <b>Romans 8</b>), believers are already saved 
and are positionally in heaven because they are in Christ and Christ is in 
heaven. Note <b>Colossians 3:3-4</b>, "For you died, and your life is <u>now hidden 
with Christ</u> in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also 
will appear with him in glory."</p>
<p>If I did one thing, no 
matter how minor, that distinguished me from lost people and resulted in my 
salvation, I could boast about that one thing. But I did nothing. God did it 
all. That's why it is completely grace. No saved person can boast about 
anything as it pertains to salvation. It is not that he shouldn't, but that he 
cannot for there is nothing to boast about.</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>10</sup> For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus 
to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>God not only brings us to 
spiritual life so that we believe, He also brings us to spiritual life so that 
we fulfill the good works He has prepared for us to do. Faith and good works do 
not make a person elect, but rather they are the result of being elect, the 
fruit of genuine regeneration. They are the fruit by which Jesus said others 
would recognize His disciples. Only people who are saved can do good works <u>
that truly please God</u>, for <b>Romans 8:8</b> says, "Those controlled by the sinful 
nature cannot please God."</p>
<p>So in order to do good 
works in the fullest sense, one must already be regenerate.</p>
<p>Although this portion 
gives us a logical order of the process of conversion, let me go to some 
clear-cut Scriptures that, to my way of thinking, prove that God elects us.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But please note this: 
the term election is not double talk, it means something. If it merely meant 
God knew what people were going to do, then the authors of Scripture did us a 
disservice. The Scriptures abound with statements about God knowing what would 
happen before it did happen. We should not try to cancel out the meaning of the 
word "elect;" the term is used for a reason, to add information, not to be 
neutralized by being thrown into some circular argument. </p>
<p>I agree that God knows 
who would believe apart from election. No one. <b>Romans 3:10-11</b> is clear. But 
God knows (especially loves) certain people in advance. He knows whom He is 
going to chose before they are born. Although this contradicts the American 
idea that "all men are created equal," (which we know is not true simply by 
observation), election is, I believe, what the word of God teaches. It is not 
so much a question of whether lost people can believe, but whether they would. 
Without election, no one would believe. Yet God does hold every person 
responsible. I admit that this creates a difficult question, but the question 
did not stop Paul. They raised it on him in <b>Romans 9</b> (a text we will see later).</p>
<p>But please note this: <u><b>If what we teach about salvation matches what 
Paul taught, we should logically provoke the same questions that Paul's readers 
asked.</b></u> <i>If our "plan 
of salvation" could not logically raise the questions that Paul addressed when 
he presented the Gospel, then there is something defective in our presentation.</i> 
Does that make sense to you? </p>
<p>But first, let us note 
the basis of God's electing of both individuals and His nation. We can begin 
with the reason for God choosing Israel from </span><b>Deuteronomy 7:7-8</b> 
"The L<span class="sm">ORD</span> did 
not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than 
other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the 
L<span class="sm">ORD</span> loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers."</p>
<p>God's singling out 
Israel for His blessing had nothing to do with the people's might or 
disposition. God had a special love for them because He had a special love for 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In this sense, He "foreknew" or foreloved this 
nation. But His choice of that nation had nothing to do with a special openness 
to God (they were often called a stubborn and stiff necked people).</p>
<p>Now let's talk about a 
few of many New Testament passages; please look at them in their context (you 
might take a moment and read <b>John 6</b>, at least the latter half); I think you will 
agree that I have not torn them out of context:</p>
<blockquote><b>NIV John 6:37</b> All that the Father gives me will come to me, 
and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</blockquote>
<p>Note the promise that "All" 
the Father gives Jesus WILL come to Him, and those Who come (because they are 
given as a gift by the Father) will never be driven away. Jesus will not reject 
the Father's gift. The only condition for coming to Jesus in this way is that 
one be a gift from the Father. Once the elect (another way of saying those who 
are the Father's gift) do come, they are never in danger of being rejected.</p>
<p>This passage clearly 
teaches that salvation is dependent upon the Father's choice of individuals who 
make up a gift to the Son. It also strongly argues for eternal security.</p>
<blockquote><b>NIV John 6:44</b> No one can come to me unless the Father who 
sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</blockquote>
<p>Only the elect are the true 
believers; it is impossible for someone to truly come to Jesus if He is not 
drawn by the Father. But those who are drawn are raised up. Additionally, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john66168.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 6:61-68</a>
contrasts the "disciples" who were non-elect from 
those who were elect. The non-elect found His teaching offensive; the elect 
were drawn by the Father. Even though the elect disciples failed Jesus (and 
Peter even denied Him), they demonstrated that those who truly (unlike Judas) 
come to Jesus will never be cast out.</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>38</sup> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but 
to do the will of him who sent me. <sup>39</sup> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall 
lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. <sup>40</sup> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to 
the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at 
the last day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note here again that the 
Father's will is that the Son loses none of all that the Father gave Him. Note 
also that all who look (in faith) to the Son and believe shall be resurrected to 
life.</p>
<blockquote><p><b><a name="john123940">John 12:39-40</a></b> For this reason 
	they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: &quot;He has blinded 
	their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their 
	eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note here that God's 
Sovereign hand is so active that He even deadened the hearts of many of the 
Jewish leaders in Jesus' day. Ultimately, the bottom line, whether we like it 
or not, is found in <b>Psalm 115:3</b>. "Our God is in heaven; he does whatever pleases him."</p>
<p><b>We can fight 
Him and impose our views of justice upon Him, or we can recognize that: Isaiah 55:89</b>, &quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, 
neither are your ways my ways,&quot; declares the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>. As the heavens are higher 
than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your 
thoughts."</p>
<p>Here is another clear verse 
on election:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>NIV Acts 13:48</b> When the Gentiles heard this, they were 
glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal 
life believed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the cause and effect 
relationship here. Luke is very careful to say that the result of being 
appointed to eternal life was believing, not the other way around. This helps 
reinforce the sequence Paul sets forth for us in the 
<a href="#eph2" class="reg">Ephesians 2 reference above</a>.</p>
<p>Note in the text below that those who came to 
Christ were those, "who by grace had believed." This implies that we who 
believe did so because God's undeserved grace caused us to believe!</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>27</sup> When Apollos wanted to go 
to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to 
welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those <b><u>who by grace had 
believed</u></b>.</p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 11:5-7 </b>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by 
grace. And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would 
no longer be grace. What then? What Israel <b><u>sought</u></b> so earnestly it 
did not obtain, <b><u>but the elect did</u></b>. The others were <b>hardened</b>...</p></blockquote>
<p>This passage distinguishes 
the believing remnant of Israel (Messianic Jews or "The Israel of God") from the 
non-believing Jews. </p>
<p>Note the believing Jews 
were chosen by God though His grace. Grace is the opposite of merit. When you 
accept the doctrine of election, you really learn how gracious Grace is. God 
literally does it all; the good that appears in our life flows from His grace. 
The Jews who believed did not deserve salvation anymore than those who did not. 
But they believed because God graciously softened their hearts and brought them 
to spiritual life.</p>
<p>Those who earnestly sought 
eternal life did not find it. But those chosen by God did. The others were 
hardened. Note that, in this text, God seems to be the hardener (note 
<a href="#john123940" class="reg">John 12:39-40 above</a>).</p>
<p>Now if what I am saying is 
similar to that which Paul taught, you should be ready to make an objection that 
the Romans made to Paul's teaching. You should ask, "How can God hold us 
responsible if He elects some and hardens others?" You should object, "That 
isn't fair." These are very close to the questions they asked Paul, which may 
mean I am saying what Paul said. <u>If, in your explanation of salvation, these 
questions would not arise, then you are not teaching what Paul taught</u>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>NIV Romans 9:14-16</b> What then 
shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! For he says to Moses, 'I will have 
	mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have 
	compassion.' It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but 
	on God's mercy.</p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 9:19-24</b> One of you will say to me: &quot;<u>Then why does God still blame us</u>? For who resists 
his will?&quot; But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? &quot;Shall what is formed 
say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'&quot; Does not the potter 
have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble 
purposes and some for common use? What if God, choosing to show his wrath and 
make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his 
wrath--prepared for destruction? What if he did this to make the riches of his 
glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for 
glory--even us, <u>whom he also called</u>, not only from the Jews but also from 
the Gentiles?</p></blockquote>
<p>You know, I think we've got 
a match! Interestingly, Paul does not provide us with a satisfying answer; he 
merely reaffirms the reality of God's nature and ways. We do not have to like 
to the sovereignty of God to accept it.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn33">Putting It All Together Sequentially</a></b></p>
<p>Here, then, seems to be the 
logical sequence of events:</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>The Persons of the

matter). The plan was that the Son would become the "the Lamb that was slain

<li><p> God planned to create 
the world and mankind, and chose his elect beforehand (God did not "wing it" as 
things went along).</p>
<li><p> God regenerates each of 
His elect children; at the point of regeneration, believers are already legally 
seated with Christ in heaven and have received the deposit of God's Spirit.</p>
<p>Afterward, these 
regenerate elect choose to repent and believe the Gospel (or believe the Gospel 
and repent – the order is debatable); those ordained to eternal life believe. 
Although this all may take place in a split second, there is a sequence of 
events here, causes and effects. Ideally, through proper teaching, the believer 
follows His Savior in believer's baptism by immersion. </p>
<li><p> God keeps these elect 
saved and works in them both to "will and do of His good pleasure." He will 
discipline His elect when they stray; He will even take His elect home early 
(like Ananias and Saphira) rather than allow them to lose their salvation. God 
know the wheat from the tares, the seed that fell on the soil He prepared as 
opposed to the other soils. </p></ol>
<p><b><a name="sctn34">Questions Raised By Election</a></b></p>
<p>As mentioned above, 
this doctrine raises many questions, most of which are fairly easy to answer. 
But the point here is that whatever questions are raised, this doctrine stands 
and all answers must be given in light of it. Although there are a number of 
additional verses we can use to bolster the argument for straightforward 
election, I think I have presented enough verses for the open-minded student of 
Scripture to consider.</p>
<p>So if salvation 
requires faith and repentance, then the elect will believe and have faith. If 
salvation requires faith, repentance, baptism, and skipping on one leg, the 
elect will do that.</p>
<p>This posture now gives 
us a less desperate, less panic-driven approach to investigate the Scriptures to 
see whether baptism is necessary for complete obedience or whether it is 
necessary for salvation, two very different though related questions.</p>
<p>Some super quick answers to a few of the questions that flow from the 
doctrine of election....</p>
<p>I am not going to 
attempt to back all these answers up with Scripture at this time, nor answer 
them more than briefly. My only purpose here is to show that there are answers, 
even though they may not all satisfy us. </p>
<p><b><a name="sctn35">Common Questions That Arise When One Embraces 
Unconditional Election</a></b></p>
<p><b>Q: Why witness?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> (1) For the same 
reason we do anything – to glorify God. We offer Him a sweet sacrifice when we 
witness, whether an aroma of life or death 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/2cor21516.htm')" target=_self class=pop>2 Corinthians 2:15-16</a>); 
(2) to fulfill the Great Commission 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt281920.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 28:19-20</a>); 
and (3) to be used of God and rewarded for the same (implied in 
<b>Philippians 4:1</b>). 
Indeed, many great missionaries (like William 
Carey, considered the first modern missionary) and evangelists and pastors (like 
Jonathan Edwards, Whitfield, and Spurgeon) believed in election (as did 
Augustine, Calvin, and Luther).</p>
<p><b>Q: Does man have a 
free will?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> The Bible 
nowhere explicitly says man has a free will. I do think the Bible teaches that 
men are responsible for their actions, choices, and attitudes. But we certainly 
do not have a free will in the physical realm (I cannot float across the room, 
no matter how often I decide to do so), so it should not surprise us that we 
have freedom <b>only within boundaries</b> in the spiritual realm. J.I. 
Packer's book, <u>Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God</u> grapples with this 
issue. I prefer to use the term responsibility. </p>
<p><b>Q: If election and 
eternal security are true doctrines, then why not sin all you want? What 
restraint is there?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Our baptism 
indicates God's desire for our lives (see later under <b>Romans 6</b>), living the 
resurrection lifestyle. Although I prefer the term "Perseverance of the 
Believer" to "Eternal Security," the bottom line is the same: once GENUINELY 
saved, always saved. But, when viewed from a perseverance perspective, it 
presents a truer picture: a genuinely saved person will continue to believe and 
if he falls away from the Lord, he will return; the Lord would take him home to 
glory before He would allow the errant one to lose his salvation.</p>
<p>Because a man or woman 
is elect, he or she is given a new nature that <i>predisposes that person to 
seek and serve God</i>. Additionally, assurance of salvation is partly based 
upon lifestyle. Believers who are not living for the Lord <i>could and should</i> 
question the genuineness of their conversion (see 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/2cor135.htm')" target=_self class=pop>2 Corinthians 13:5</a>) and Peter 
admonishes the believer to, "be all the more eager to make your calling and 
election sure" (<b>2 Peter 1:10</b>). God is sure, but our lifestyle and pattern of 
growth assures us.</p>
<p>So part of being a 
genuine believer IS the motivation to walk with the Lord. On the fear side, we 
can fear the disciple of the Lord, which is no pleasantry, and we will appear 
before the judgment seat of Christ in which every work will be evaluated. This, 
however, will not determine heaven or hell (lost people do not appear at the 
judgment seat of Christ, but at the Great White Throne), but rewards and review 
are in mind. But the real motivation is a positive one: the implanted desire to 
glorify God as a result of the Law of God written on our hearts.</p>
<p>There are other 
motivations besides fear of not "making it to heaven." As a matter of fact, if 
salvation were properly taught and an individual truly believes, that fear 
should forever be gone, at least that's what I understand <b>Hebrews</b> implies:
<b>2:14-15</b> "Since the children have flesh and blood, he too 
shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the 
power of death--that is, the devil-- and free those who all their lives were 
held in slavery by their fear of death."</p>
<p>Those believers who 
recognize God's Sovereign grace do not live life in the fear of death. The fear they have is 
displeasing their master, being saved, but so as "by fire&quot; 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1cor315.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Corinthians 3:15</a>), 
and the chastening hand of God. </p>
<p><b>Q: Isn't the quality 
of spiritual life better for Arminians?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> I do not think 
so, at least, not in my personal observation. I think there are lost people who 
think they are saved and hide behind eternal security just as there are Arminians 
who avoid serving the Lord because they want to wait to the end, or 
who are "in and out" of the kingdom. Just as children tend to turn out better 
when they know their parents accept them, despite their infractions, so, I 
believe, God's children work best from a perspective of acceptance. Fear of 
hell does restrain some sin, but, if one stops there, the deeper motivations of 
the child of God are never realized, and these other motivations (mentioned 
above) are stronger in the long run.</p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn4">Is Old Testament Salvation That Different from 
New?</a></p>
<p><b><a name="sctn41">Nicodemus, A Teacher of the Jews Who Should Have 
Known About the New Birth...</a></b></p>
<p><b>John 3:1-21</b> is a frequently quoted text by 
Bible-oriented Christians:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>1</sup> Now there 
was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling 
council. <sup>2</sup> He came to Jesus at night and said, &quot;Rabbi, we know you are a teacher 
who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are 
doing if God were not with him.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>3</sup> In reply 
Jesus declared, &quot;I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless 
he is born again." </p>
<p><sup>4</sup> &quot;How can a 
man be born when he is old?&quot; Nicodemus asked. &quot;Surely he cannot enter a second 
time into his mother's womb to be born!&quot; </p>
<p><sup>5</sup> Jesus 
answered, &quot;I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he 
is born of water and the Spirit. <sup>6</sup> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit 
gives birth to spirit. <sup>7</sup> You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be 
born again.' <sup>8</sup> The wind 
blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it 
comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.&quot;&nbsp;
	</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> &quot;How can this 
be?&quot; Nicodemus asked. </p>
<p><sup>10</sup> <u>&quot;You are Israel's teacher,&quot; said Jesus, 
&quot;and do you not understand these things?&quot; </u><sup>11</sup> I tell you 
the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but 
still you people do not accept our testimony. <sup>12</sup> I have spoken to you of earthly 
things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly 
things? <sup>13</sup> No one has 
ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. <sup>
14</sup> Just 
as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 
<sup>15</sup> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. </p>
	<p><sup>16</sup> &quot;For God so loved the 
world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not 
perish but have eternal life. <sup>17</sup> For God did not send his Son into the world to 
condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup>18</sup> Whoever believes in him 
is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because 
he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. <sup>19</sup> This is the 
verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light 
because their deeds were evil. <sup>20</sup> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will 
not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. <sup>21</sup> But whoever 
lives by the truth comes into the light, <u>
so that it may be seen plainly that 
what he has done has been done through God</u>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nicodemus was not just 
a devout Jew; he was a Rabbi who was also part of the "ruling council" known as 
the Sanhedrin. <u><b>It is worth noting that Jesus expected Nicodemus to be 
familiar with His teaching that a man must be born of water and the spirit. 
This implies that <i>whatever Jesus taught was also seen in the Old Testament</i>.</b></u> 
Hence we know that water here does NOT refer to baptism, for believers were not 
baptized in Old Testament times.</p>
<p>The key to unlocking 
this mystery is the fact that both the Old Testament Hebrew word (ruach) and the 
equivalent New Testament word (pneuma), can mean "spirit" or "wind" or "breath" 
(you might recognize the term "pneumonia"). The context determines whether the 
term is translated "wind" or "spirit" or "breath." Jesus uses this play on 
words by saying that whom the Spirit regenerates is unpredictable because the 
"wind blows where it will." He adds, "so is everyone who is born of the wind" 
(or spirit).</p>
<p>Here are the passages I 
believe Jesus expected Nicodemus to recall, passages that deal with being born 
of water and/or wind:</p>
<p><b>Ezekiel 36:25-27</b> I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be 
clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols. I 
will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you 
your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in 
you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.</p>
<p><b>Ezekiel 37:9-10</b> Then 
he said to me, &quot;Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, 
'This is what the Sovereign L<span class="sm">ORD</span> says: Come from the 
four winds, O breath, and breathe into these slain, that they may live.'&quot; So I 
prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and 
stood up on their feet--a vast army.</p>
<p>Also in <b>Ezekiel 18:31</b>, 
we read, "Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new 
heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, O house of Israel?"</p>
<p>Of King Saul, we read 
in <b>1 Samuel 10:6</b>, "The Spirit of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> will come upon you in power, and you 
will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person…."
</p>
<p>Of course one point in 
Jesus' explanation is that it is out of the hands of man to be born again, but 
is as mysterious as the wind and rain. It takes a sovereign act of the 
sovereign God to work the miracle of regeneration. That's why John writes, in 
the prologue of his gospel, "Yet to all who received him, to those who believed 
in his name, he gave the right to become children of God-- children born not of 
natural descent, <b><i>nor of human decision</i></b> or a husband's will, but 
born of God" (<b>John 1:12-13</b>).</p>
<p>Now if Jesus taught 
that baptism WAS necessary to salvation, and this was before His resurrection, 
then the thief on the cross could not be said to have been saved because He 
lived before Christ arose. You can't have it both ways. </p>
<p><b><a name="sctn42">Paul's Arguments Become Meaningless If People Were 
Saved Differently in the Old Testament Than the New (Romans 3-4).</a></b></p>
<p>Under the Old Covenant, 
animal sacrifices could avert the wrath of God physically and outwardly so that 
the people of Israel could become "clean" to participate in Israel's religious 
life and festivals. The sacrifices could not cleanse the inward man, but simply 
covered (the idea of the Hebrew word kippur, atonement) over sin. <i>To put it 
in slang terms, it kept God from zapping them like He zapped Uzzah for touching 
the Ark. The modern Jewish skull cap (kippa) is 
based upon the same concept: the covering hides man's sinfulness from God. As 
<b>Hebrews 10:4</b> tells us, </i>"because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats 
to take away sins." </p>
<p>Impossible means just 
that. Although not all saved people understood as much as Job, the basis of 
their salvation was still the work of Christ. <b>Job 19:25-27</b> reads: &quot;I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will 
stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I 
will see God; I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my 
heart yearns within me!&quot;</p>
<p>The sacrifice of 
Christ, on the other hand, not only covered sin, but it washed sin away. Jesus 
presented His sacrifice to the Father as an offering for all our sins for all 
times (see 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/heb912152428.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Hebrews 9:12-15, 24-28</a>).</p>
<p>Most Israelites were 
not concerned about being "clean" on a daily basis, since their eternal destiny 
did not hinge upon ceremonial cleanliness. Instead, they were concerned about 
ceremonial cleansing when it became necessary to participate in a community 
religious event. Their salvation hinged upon being rightly related to God 
through faith, as Paul expounded.</p>
<p>Salvation can be 
divided into two segments: <b>objective</b> and <b>subjective</b>. Objectively, 
salvation was provided when Christ bore our sins on the cross as the sacrificial 
Lamb of God. He offered Himself to the Father on our behalf (see 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1cor315.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 5:8-10</a>, 
<b>1 Corinthians 15-15</b>, and 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1cor315.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Hebrews 9:11-15</a>).</p>
<p>On this matter, 
conservative Roman Catholics and conservative Protestants tend to agree. Luther 
and Calvin rightly understood that the Catholic Church was right about a number 
of things, including the nature of the atonement.</p>
<p>Where Luther and Calvin 
disagreed with Catholicism was in the realm of <i>Subjective</i> Salvation (the 
technical term would be Subjective Soteriology). Luther and Calvin 
understood Paul's arguments in books like Romans and Galatians, to the effect 
that salvation was by faith (<i>personal trust</i>) not the practice of religion 
(including rituals and good works). Catholicism said salvation came by grace, 
but grace was measured out by the church through an ordained priesthood in small 
allotments through the seven "sacraments" and other works of piety.</p>
<p>Paul's argument in 
<b>Romans 3</b> and <b>especially 4</b> and <b>Galatians</b> is that <b><u>God has ALWAYS saved 
people the same way, by faith</u></b> (in contrast to works or rituals). That 
the intellectual content of faith between Old Testament believers and New 
Covenant saints differs is obvious. But the subjective element, forgiveness and 
salvation by faith (which is often linked to and inclusive of repentance) has 
remained constant.</p>
<p>Note these early verses 
of <b>Romans 4</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>1</sup> What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, 
discovered in this matter? <sup>2</sup> If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had 
something to boast about--but not before God. <sup>3</sup> What does the Scripture say? &quot;<b>Abraham believed God, 
and it was credited to him as righteousness</b>.&quot; </p>
<p> <sup>4</sup> <u> <b>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited 
to him as a gift, but as an obligation.</b></u> <sup>5</sup> <u> <b>However, to the man who does not work but trusts 
God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</b></u>
<sup>6</sup> David says the same thing when he speaks of the 
blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: </p>
<p> <sup>7</sup> &quot;Blessed are they whose <i>transgressions are forgiven</i>, 
whose <i>sins are covered. </i></p>
<p> <sup>8</sup> Blessed is the man <i>whose sin the Lord will never 
count against him.&quot; </i></p>
<p> <sup>9</sup> Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also 
for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to 
him as righteousness. <sup>10</sup> Under what circumstances was it credited? <b>Was it 
after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!</b> <sup>11</sup> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of 
the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So 
then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in 
order that righteousness might be credited to them. <sup>12</sup> And he is also the father of the circumcised who not 
only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our 
father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note in this text that 
both David and Abraham were forgiven or declared righteous (justified) by their 
faith. Rather than God counting our sins against us, He counts us as righteous.</p>
<p>Where do rituals come 
into play? Again, Paul is clear: the ritual follows the justification. In the 
case of Abraham, he was justified first, while still uncircumcised. But because 
he was saved, he now wanted to follow the Lord and therefore obeyed the command 
to practice circumcision.</p>
<p>Abraham was justified 
before God when he exercised faith and justified in the eyes of others when he 
obeyed. I would suggest the same holds true with baptism. We are saved when we 
believe, but we are recognized by the church community and society at large as a 
follower of Christ when we submit to baptism.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in 
Muslim countries, converts to Christianity are not persecuted until they follow 
the Lord in baptism (any mode). In the early church and anywhere where 
Christianity carries a price tag, baptism communicates identification with the 
faith of Jesus Christ; the individual moves from a seeker to a finder to an 
outward profession of faith.</p>
<p>But back to our 
subject. Why does God ALWAYS save by grace through faith? The underlying issue 
is related to "why anything?" The big picture answer is "to glorify God" (see 
<a href="#appendix3" class="reg">Appendix 3</a>). Only salvation by Sovereign Grace through faith can bring maximum 
glory to God.</p>
<p>Sovereign Grace means 
God gets 100% of the credit. Faith is the ultimate way to glorify God, since it 
focuses upon the very nature and character of God. Faith affirms that God is 
faithful, dependable, gracious, good, and keeps His Word. Unbelief is the 
opposite of glorifying God, for it calls His very character in question.</p>
<p>Dr. Ron Moseley, in his 
book, <u>Yeshua, A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original Church</u> 
(Messianic Jewish Publishers, Baltimore, 1996) comments on pages 70-71,</p>
<blockquote><p>The notion that the 
grace of God originated with Paul is not only wrong, but shows a grave 
negligence on the part of the Church concerning its roots in Jewish history and 
faith. Abundant records, written in Jewish literature before the time of 
Christ, speak of the grace of God as the sole means of salvation. The 
Thanksgiving Scroll (one of the Dead Sea Scrolls) is an excellent example. It 
declares, &quot;Only by your goodness is man righteous or justified and by the 
multitude of your mercy...and by your magnificence you have glorified him.&quot; How 
much more clearer could it be than when this scroll says, &quot;By Your grace You did 
save my soul, for from You is my step&quot;? The scroll also says, &quot;And all the sons 
	of Your truth You bring forgivingly before You to purify them from their 
	sins by the plenty of Your goodness and the multitude of Your mercies to 
	make them stand before you forever.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn5">The Jewish Understanding of Baptism</a></p>
<p><b><a name="sctn51">The Common Rabbinic Understanding</a></b></p>
<p>In first century 
Judaism, gentiles who were wicked and unrepentant (the vast majority) were 
called goyim, gentiles. Those who wanted to be saved and believed in the true 
God were called "fearers" (the Hebrew term means foreigners living in the land); 
these repented of their sins and believed in the God of Israel as the only true 
God. They were considered forgiven and heaven-bound by the Rabbis, and were 
expected to keep the 7 Commandments implied within the Covenant of Noah 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/gen9118.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Genesis 9:1-18</a>), 
including: 1) no idolatry, 2) no incest/adultery; 3) no murder; 4) 
no blasphemy/misusing God's name, 5) no theft; 6) practice justice toward 
others, and 7) no eating flesh with blood in it or cutting flesh from a living 
animal.</p>
<p>If they wanted to 
become fuller converts (but not full) to Judaism, they could become known as 
"God fearers." They would keep the 7 commands of Noah, practice the Sabbath, 
eat kosher, and participate in synagogue discipleship.</p>
<p>Lastly were the 
Proselytes (the "righteous foreigners") who did all the above plus observing 
circumcision and mikveh (baptism), practicing Temple sacrifices, tithing, etc...</p>
<p>Baptism was considered 
the initiation into the religious community, thus placing the converts under the 
Mosaic Law, the priesthood, and rabbis. They were not identified as part of the 
community of Israel until they were baptized; <i>they were considered saved 
earlier, as "Fearers," when they turned from their sins to the true God</i>, <b>
<u>NOT</u></b> when they were baptized. Baptism was the identifying ritual 
initiating them into the privileges and responsibilities of keeping the Law.</p>
<p>(For documentation, 
see, Fischer, John, (editor), <u>The Enduring Paradox: Exploratory Essays in 
Messianic Judaism</u>, Messianic Jewish Publishers, Baltimore, 2000, pp. 
174-178.)</p>
<p>Since Judaism was well 
known throughout the Roman world (and gentiles by the drove were being converted 
to Judaism in the first century), this understanding of baptism was common 
then. It was, I believe, carried over into the church's understanding.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn52">John's Baptism</a></b></p>
<p>"Baptism" comes from the 
Greek word "baptizo," meaning "to immerse or dip." We understand the Scriptures 
to teach that believers in Christ are to be immersed in "the name of the Father, 
Son, and Holy Spirit." Although baptism may be the formalizing of conversion, 
we believe individuals are saved at the point of belief. </p>
<p>Here is some interesting 
material from Brad Young's book, <i>Jesus, the Jewish Theologian</i>, pp.15-16:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the Jewish teachings of 
the Mishnah, living water—defined as rivers or seas—was the highest grade of 
cleansing for ritual immersion (m. <i>Mikvaot</i> 1:6). The person was required 
to be immersed in living water which could be collected from rain or rivers. … 
It is … significant that the Dead Sea sect required religious purity before 
baptism. The individual seeking baptism was required to turn from wickedness 
before entering the waters of ritual immersion. Repentance preceded baptism in 
the Dead Sea community.</p>
<p>John the Baptist 
employed the same standard. The one who desired baptism was required first to 
turn from sin and then approach the waters with a pure heart. … Josephus 
explains that in John's teachings repentance purified the soul while baptism 
cleansed the body. Josephus remarks concerning John the Baptist:</p>
<blockquote>For Herod had 
put him (John the Baptist) to death, though he was a good man and 
had exhorted the Jews to lead righteous lives, to practice 
justice towards their fellows and piety towards God, and  so doing to join in 
baptism. In his view this was a necessary  preliminary&nbsp;if baptism was to 
be acceptable to God. They must not employ it to gain pardon for 
whatever sins they committed, but as a consecration of the body implying 
that the soul was already thoroughly cleansed by right behavior.</blockquote>
<p>John called on the people 
to practice piety and pursue a lifestyle of right conduct. The center of John 
the Baptist's activities was located close to the geographical area of Tel 
Qumran and near the caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. Moreover, 
John's theological understanding of baptism seems to be similar to the approach 
taken to the ritual immersion practiced by the Dead Sea sect. Was John a member 
of the Dead Sea community?...No...He did not stipulate that they sell all 
their possessions and join his group of disciples who waited for the last days 
in the wilderness. Instead his prophetic message implored the people to live a 
holy life in the mainstream of society. <u>The religious mindset at Qumran could 
not tolerate John's approach</u>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jesus' teachings often 
paralleled and agreed with those of Hillel. So in first century Judaism, a 
gentile would be considered saved apart from becoming a FULL Jew, but could be a 
God-fearing gentile (like Cornelius). When he wanted to become a full convert, 
the ritual necessary to welcome him into the Jewish community was baptism (by 
immersion). (See also <u>Yeshua: A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original 
Church </u>by Ron, Dr. Moseley</a>,

<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn6">Jesus Example of Pronouncing People Saved Apart 
from Baptism and the Multitude of Passages Which Declare Salvation Is by Faith 
(Belief)</a></p>
<p><b><a name="sctn61">Baptism Was Available Then, But Jesus Did Not Require 
It of Those He Pronounced "Saved" or "Forgiven" by Faith as a Condition.</a></b></p>
<p>Take <b>Luke 7:47</b>, where 
the sinful woman had washed Christ's feet with her tears:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>47</sup> &quot;Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been 
forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little.&quot;
</p>
<p><sup>48</sup> Then Jesus said to her, &quot;Your sins are forgiven.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>49</sup> The other guests began to say among themselves, &quot;Who 
is this who even forgives sins?&quot; </p>
<p><sup>50</sup> Jesus said to the woman, &quot;Your faith has saved you; 
go in peace.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that Jesus 
pronounced her forgiven and saved by faith. </p>
<p>In <b>Mark 2:5</b>, Jesus said 
this to the man lowered from the roof: &quot;When Jesus saw their faith, 
he said to the paralytic, 'Son, your sins are 
forgiven.'&quot; Note that this forgiveness was in response to faith, not baptism.</p>
<p>In the parable of the 
sower, in <b>Luke 8:12</b>, we find why people are not saved when they hear the word: 
they do not believe: "Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the 
devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not 
believe and be saved."</p>
<p>Another key verse comes 
from <b>Luke's Gospel, 23:39-43</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>39</sup> "One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: 
&quot;Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!&quot; </p>
	<p><sup>40</sup> But the other criminal rebuked 
him. &quot;Don't you fear God,&quot; he said, &quot;since you are under the same sentence? 
	<sup>41</sup> We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds 
deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>42</sup> Then he said, &quot;Jesus, remember me when you come into your 
kingdom." </p>
<p><sup>43</sup> Jesus answered him, &quot;I tell you the truth, <b><u>today you 
will be with me in paradise</u></b>.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems clear that 
this thief was going to join Jesus in paradise, apart from being baptized. 
Since baptism was in fact being practiced by Jesus and His disciples. <b>John 
4:1-2</b> reads: &quot;The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more 
disciples than John, although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his 
disciples...&quot; So the argument that 
things changed regarding baptism after the resurrection does not -- excuse the 
pun -- hold water.</p>
<p>John's Gospel is 
considered the simplest Gospel to understand. It presents the salvation message 
repeatedly. Unlike the three other Gospels (called the "synoptics," i.e., "with 
the eye together—through the same eyes"), John presents the message to readers
<i>without</i> an Old Testament/Jewish background. Hence he makes the message 
clear to those without a first century Jewish background – readers like us!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note some of these verses (with my comments in italics and brackets) that say 
it is belief (faith) in Christ that makes a person right with God (forgiven, 
saved) <b>John 3:14-21</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>14</sup> "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the 
desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up <i>[the atonement on the cross</i>], 
	<sup>15</sup> that everyone who <b><u>believes</u></b> in him may have eternal life. </p>
		<p><sup>16</sup> &quot;For 
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes 
in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <sup>17</sup> For God did not send his Son into the world <i>[the first 
time]</i> to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. <sup>18</sup> Whoever <b>
<u>believes</u></b> in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands 
condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only 
Son. <sup>19</sup> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men 
loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. <sup>20</sup> Everyone who 
does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his 
deeds will be exposed. <sup>21</sup> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so 
that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God" <i>
[here we see that God works repentance and prepares one to receive salvation; 
man does not prepare himself].</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Just before 
resurrecting Lazarus, Jesus said this in <b>John 11:25-26</b>, </span>"Jesus said to 
her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. <b><u>He who believes</u></b> in me 
will live, even though he dies; and <b><u>whoever lives and believes in me</u></b> 
will never die. Do you believe this?'"</p>
<p>Note Jesus did <b><u>
not</u></b> say, "whoever lives and believes in me <b><u>AND</u></b> is 
baptized."</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn62">The Emphasis of the New Testament</a></b></p>
<p>John, in <b>John 20:31</b>, 
reveals his theme and purpose for writing his Gospel account: "But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is 
the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his 
name." Now it might be argued 
that John expected believers to follow the Lord in baptism. I concur that he 
did. But it is nonetheless believing that results in life through His name.</p>
<p>In <b>Acts 15:9</b>, during 
the Jerusalem council, Peter says the following when referring to the conversion 
of the gentiles: "He made no distinction between us and them, for he 
purified their hearts by faith." The heart is purified 
by faith; he does not say, "faith AND baptism." Where these believers 
baptized? Absolutely. But when were they purified? When they exercised saving 
faith.</p>
<p>Paul summarized the 
call he made while preaching evangelistically in <b>Acts 20:21</b>,
</span>"I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in 
repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus."</p>
<p>The relationship of 
repentance to faith is simply this: one cannot be saved unless one wants to be 
saved, but saved from what? From sin and its consequence: a severed 
relationship with God and eternal separation from God. The desire to be saved 
from sin IS repentance (see a more detailed discussion in 
<a href="#appendix5" class="reg">Appendix 5</a>.)</p>
<p>When Paul recites his 
calling to King Agrippa, he quotes Christ as follows in <b>Acts 26:17-18</b>, </span>
"I will rescue you from your own people and from the 
Gentiles. I am sending you to them, to open their eyes and turn them from 
darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive 
forgiveness of sins and a place <b><u>among those who are sanctified by faith</u></b> 
in me.'"</p>
<p>Paul argues repeatedly 
that it is faith (believing, the Greek word, pisteuo) that justifies (makes one 
legally righteous before God) and saves the believer. Other writers also make 
similar comments. Here are many simple and succinct statements that claim it is 
through faith (believing) that we are saved/forgiven/justified:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>NIV Romans 1:17</b> For in the 
gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, <b><u>a righteousness that is by 
faith from first to last</u></b>, just as it is written: &quot;The righteous will 
live <b><u>by faith</u></b>.&quot; </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 3:22-23 <u>This righteousness 
from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ</u></b> to all who <b><u>believe</u></b>. 
There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the 
glory of God.</p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 3:25-28</b> God presented 
him as a sacrifice of atonement, through <b><u> faith in his blood</u></b>. He 
did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the 
sins committed beforehand unpunished--he did it to 
demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who 
justifies <b><u>those who have faith in Jesus</u></b>. Where, then, 
is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? 
No, but on that <b><u>of faith</u></b>. For we 
maintain that a man is justified <b><u>by faith apart from observing the law.
</u></b> </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 3:30</b> Since there is 
only one God, who will justify <b><u>the circumcised by faith</u></b> and the <b>
<u>uncircumcised through that same faith</u></b>. </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 4:5</b> However, to the 
man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, <b><u>his faith 
is credited as righteousness</u></b>. </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 4:9</b> Is this 
blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have 
been saying that Abraham's <b><u>faith</u></b> was credited to him as 
righteousness. </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 4:13-14</b> It was not 
through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be 
heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes <b><u>by faith</u></b>.
For if those 
who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless, 
</p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 5:1-2</b> Therefore, 
since we have been <b><u>justified through faith</u></b>, we have peace with God 
through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we 
have gained <b><u>access by faith</u></b> into this grace in which we now stand. 
And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 9:30</b> What then 
shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained 
it, <b><u>a righteousness that is by faith</u></b>.<u><b> </b> </u></p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 9:32</b> Why not? 
Because they pursued it <b><u>not by faith</u></b> but as if it were by works. 
They stumbled over the &quot;stumbling stone.&quot; </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 11:20</b> Granted. But 
they were broken off because of unbelief, and <b><u>you stand by faith</u></b>. 
Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 2:16</b> Know that a 
man is not justified by observing the law, but <b><u>by faith in Jesus Christ</u></b>. 
So we, too, <b><u>have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by 
faith in Christ</u></b> and not by observing the law, because by observing the 
law no one will be justified. </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 2:20</b> I have been 
crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I 
live in the body, <b><u>I live by faith in the Son of God</u></b>, who loved me 
and gave himself for me. </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 3:8</b> The 
Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles <b><u>by faith</u></b>, 
and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: &quot;All nations will be blessed 
through you.&quot; </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 3:11</b> Clearly no 
one is justified before God by the law, because, &quot;<b><u>The righteous will live 
by faith</u></b>.&quot; </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 3:14</b> He redeemed 
us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles 
through Christ Jesus, so that <b><u>by faith</u></b> we might receive the 
promise of the Spirit. </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 3:22</b> But the 
Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was 
promised, being <b><u>given through faith in Jesus Christ</u></b>, might be 
given to <b><u>those who believe</u></b>. </p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 3:24</b> So the law 
was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be <b><u>justified by faith</u></b>.
</p>
<p><b>NIV Galatians 3:26</b> You are all 
sons of God <u> <b>through faith in Christ Jesus</b></u>.</p>
<p><b>NIV Ephesians 2:8-10 </b>For it is by grace you have 
been saved, <b><u>through faith</u></b>--and this not from yourselves, it is the 
gift of God--not by works, so that no one 
can boast. For we are God's 
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in 
advance for us to do. </p>
<p><b>NIV Ephesians 3:12</b> In him and
<b><u>through faith</u></b> in him we may approach God with freedom and 
confidence. </p>
<p><b>NIV Ephesians 3:17</b> So that 
Christ may dwell in your hearts <b><u>through faith</u></b>. And I pray that 
you, being rooted and established in love, </p>
<p><b>NIV Philippians 3:9</b> And be 
found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but
<b><u>that which is through faith</u></b> in Christ--the righteousness that 
comes from God and is by faith. </p>
<p><b>NIV 1 John 5:4-5 </b>For everyone born of God 
overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, <b><u>even 
our faith</u></b>. Who is it that overcomes the 
world? <b><u>Only he who believes</u></b> that Jesus is the Son of God. </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 4:23-25 </b>The words &quot;it was credited 
to him&quot; were written not for him alone, but also for us, to whom 
God will credit righteousness--for us <b><u>who</u></b> <b><u>believe in him</u></b> 
who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. He was delivered over to 
death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification. </p>
<p><b>NIV Romans 10:9-11 </b>That if you confess with 
your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; <b><u>and believe in your heart</u></b> that God 
raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <b><u>For it is with your 
heart that you believe and are justified</u></b>, and it is with your mouth that 
you confess and are saved.<sup> </sup>As the Scripture says, 
&quot;Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.&quot; </p>
<p><b>NIV 1 Corinthians 1:21</b> For 
since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God 
was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached <b><u>to save those who 
believe</u></b>. </p>
<p><b>NIV 1 Timothy 1:16</b> But for 
that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ 
Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example <b><u>for those who 
would believe on him and receive eternal life. </u></b></p>
<p><b>NIV 1 Timothy 4:9-10 </b>This is a trustworthy 
saying that deserves full acceptance (and for this we labor and 
strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, <b><u>who is the Savior of 
all men, and especially of those who believe</u></b>.<u><b> </b> </u></p>
<p><b>NIV Hebrews 10:39</b> But we are 
not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, <b><u>but of those who believe 
and are saved</u></b>.<u><b> </b> </u></p>
<p><b>NIV 1 John 5:13</b> I write these 
things <b><u>to you who believe</u></b> in the name of the Son of God so that <b>
you may <u>know</u> that you have eternal life</b>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the classic proof 
that baptism is not absolutely necessary for salvation is the "Thief on the 
Cross" who was never baptized:</p>
<p><b>Luke 23:39-43</b> is most 
significant; it reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>39</sup> "One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: 
&quot;Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!&quot; </p>
	<p><sup>40</sup> But the other criminal rebuked 
him. &quot;Don't you fear God,&quot; he said, &quot;since you are under the same sentence? 
	<sup>41</sup> We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds 
deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>42</sup> Then he said, &quot;Jesus, remember me when you come into your 
kingdom." </p>
<p><sup>43</sup> Jesus answered him, &quot;I tell you the truth, <b><u>today you 
will be with me in paradise</u></b>.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p><b><a name="sctn63">Drawing an Inference</a></b></p>
<p>If it is argued that 
there was no "Christian" baptism during Jesus earthly life, then we end up with 
a predicament where the very Savior of the world does not demonstrate proper 
evangelism for the church era He was about to found. That there is a difference 
between God's dealings with Israel and the Church seems clear enough to me, but 
Jesus DID say He was about to build His church and He did train His apostles to 
lead that church.</p>
<p>What did change after 
Pentecost was the believer's relationship to the Holy Spirit and the whole 
concept of the body of Christ. But the Savior has always saved people through 
faith apart from works or rituals.</p>
<p>An area for further 
exploration is the validity of the baptism of the apostles before the baptismal 
formula was given (in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) after their 
profession. We end up with a bunch of unbaptized apostles (except Paul), 
because they knew John's baptism. Yet there is no record of the Apostles or the 
120 being baptized on or after Pentecost. Of course, this is an argument from 
silence, but we have to wonder why the apostles were not re-baptized as were 
some of those in Acts who only knew John's baptism. We have no record of Peter, 
for example, being baptized AFTER his confession that Jesus was "the Christ, the 
Son of the Living God."</p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn7">Passages Pro and Con: In the Hermeneutical 
Trenches</a></p>
<p>In this section, I will 
attempt to address a number of verses that are used to promote the idea that 
baptism is absolutely necessary for salvation. Again, I will remind readers 
that I do agree that it is God's will for every believer to follow the Lord in 
believers' baptism by immersion after a confession of faith. That is not the 
issue here. I do not view baptism as optional, but rather as distinct from 
regeneration and salvation. It is, in my opinion, the formalization of 
conversion.</p>
<p>When you have the firm 
foundation of a Sovereign God who chooses His elect (apart from any foreseen 
response in them) and guarantees their conversion and final destiny by His side, 
you are free to examine verses from a different perspective. If you conclude 
that the real issue is glorifying God, and that God is not desperate nor 
helpless and that neither the flow of human history nor the population of heaven 
are dependent upon man's fickleness, it affects your entire outlook.</p>
<p>Rather than being 
obsessed with "holding out" and "making it to heaven" (a phrase, incidentally, 
never found in Scripture), you can press on because you know God and are 
securely in relationship to him. The key term moves from "salvation" to 
"maturity in Christ." Heaven, the indwelling Holy Spirit, and our adoption into 
God's family are seen as several among the many consequences of being rightly 
related to God.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn71">Acts 2:38</a></b></p>
<p><b>Acts 2:38</b> is perhaps the strongest text used to promote the 
idea of baptism as necessary for salvation, so I will begin there.</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>36</sup> &quot;Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has 
made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>37</sup> When the people heard this, they were cut to the 
heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, &quot;Brothers, what shall we do?&quot;
</p>
<p><sup>38</sup> Peter replied, &quot;Repent and be baptized, every one of 
you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will 
receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sup>39</sup> The promise is for you and your children and for all 
who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>40</sup> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded 
with them, &quot;Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.&quot; <sup>41</sup> Those who accepted his message were baptized, and 
about three thousand were added to their number that day. </p>
<p><sup>42</sup> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and 
to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some interpretational 
debates center on the word, "for," which represents a translation of the Greek 
preposition "eis." Rather than haggle over how "eis" should be rendered, I 
would prefer to leave the Greek alone and simply follow the common translation, 
"for." It is not that the argument for translating "eis" as "because of" has no 
merit; I simply do not view it as the crux of the argument.</p>
<p>The Great Commission is 
often considered the "marching orders for the church.&quot; <u><b>The concern of the 
Great Commission</b></u> 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/matt281920.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Matthew 28:19-20</a>) <u><b>is not seeing people saved; 
it is, rather, making mature disciples, which begins with salvation</b></u>. This was the 
emphasis of the early church; getting saved was a key step in the discipleship 
process, not the final product.</p>
<p>And that was the focus 
of <b>Acts 2:38</b>. Those who focus more on getting to heaven rather than becoming 
mature Christians may experience a paradigm blindness that reads material into a 
text. This is true with all theological positions, including my own, and we 
should be alert to this tendency in our attempts at interpretation. </p>
<p>If we understand 
Peter's main concern on Pentecost was making disciples <b><u>who would go on to 
maturity</u></b>, not merely seeing people saved, it changes our perspective in 
contemplating his preaching.</p>
<p>The question in this 
text is NOT specifically about salvation, but rather what God expects these 
repentant Jews to do. They have realized that they have crucified and rejected 
the Messiah in <b>Acts 2</b>, </p>
<blockquote><p><sup>22</sup> </span>&quot;Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of 
Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, 
which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. <sup>23</sup> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose 
and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by 
nailing him to the cross. <sup>24</sup> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from 
the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
	</p>
<p><sup>32</sup> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all 
witnesses of the fact. </p>
<p><sup>36</sup> &quot;Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has 
made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>37</sup> <b><u>When the people heard this, they were cut to 
the heart</u></b> and said to Peter and the other apostles, &quot;Brothers, what 
shall we do?&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>What does God expect 
from them at this point, in light of their previous rejection of Jesus? 
Remember, the concern of the Great Commission is not primarily seeing people 
saved; it is producing maturing disciples (who observe all things). Note the 
Commission in <b>Matthew 28:19-20</b>: </span>"Therefore go and make disciples of all 
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 
Spirit, and<b><u> teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you</u></b>. 
And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&quot;
Salvation--which is by grace and apart from anything that can be 
"done&quot;--is merely phase one. God's will for us is never merely phase one! When 
we are disciples who have been taught and actually observe "all things," then we 
have arrived at maturity, which is a separate (but interrelated) issue from 
salvation.</p>
<p>The "forgiveness of 
sins," which we can roughly equate with salvation (they are not exactly one and 
the same, though closely related) is not the main issue here; forgiveness is, in 
this text, a consequence of knowing and following Christ and righting the wrong 
of rejecting Him by fully accepting Him.</p>
<p>Because they are told 
to do two things (repent and be baptized) does not necessarily mean that both of 
those things are <i>absolutely</i> necessary for the forgiveness of sins. That 
is not the issue under discussion. The issue is "what should we do?"</p>
<p>If the question were, 
"What are the minimal requirements for one to go to heaven at death?" that would 
be a different story. But that is not the nature of the question.</p>
<p>When the specific 
question related to salvation is asked in <b>Acts 16:30</b> (by the Philippian jailor), 
namely, "What must I do to be saved?" the answer is given specifically</span>, 
"Believe in the Lord Jesus 
Christ, and you shall be saved." We later 
learn that he and his family, were, in fact, baptized, because that is what God 
wanted them to do in addition to being saved (and it still is what God expects 
believers to do). But the answer to the more specific question, the minimal 
description of how one can be saved, is to "believe in the Lord Jesus Christ." 
Not "believe and be baptized."</p>
<p>Note that this text 
nowhere discusses what would happen to an individual who believed in Christ but 
was not baptized. It could also be argued that baptism, in this instance, was a 
test of the sincerity of repentance. Although the Bible does not directly 
answer the question, "Is baptism absolutely necessary to salvation?" it does 
frequently answer the question of how a person could be saved. If the 
overwhelmingly vast majority of texts clearly do not include baptism as a 
salvation requirement, then that question, to my way of thinking, is answered. 
We will enumerate some of those texts later in this document.</p>
<p>But first, we can find 
a relevant passage (for comparison purposes) in <b>Romans 10:9-10</b>:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>9</sup> That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; 
and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
	<sup>10</sup> For it is with your heart that you believe and are 
justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. <sup>11</sup> As the Scripture says, &quot;Anyone who trusts in him will 
never be put to shame.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note in this <b>Romans</b> 
passage there is no mention of baptism. Note in the <b>Acts 2:38</b> passage, there is 
not mention of "confessing with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord.'" And, in the 
Romans passage, we could argue that a mute (someone who cannot speak) or 
paralyzed person could never be saved. Even though he could confess Christ 
through sign language or writing, the text does say, "with his mouth."</p>
<p>The Romans passage, 
like the Acts passage, does not deal with someone who believes but does not 
confess with his mouth. If you believed in your heart, you would be considered 
righteous, but if you did not confess with your mouth, we could argue, you would 
not be saved. So a fine situation this is: righteous before God but not saved? 
No, I don't think so. The issue of what happens if you believe in your heart 
without confessing with your mouth is not addressed here. But we are told that 
if we believe with our heart, the result is righteousness. This parallels in 
many ways our passage in <b>Acts 2</b>. </p>
<p>Also note that most of 
us would agree that someone who confessed with the mouth Jesus as Lord but did 
NOT believe with the heart is clearly lost. So most of us would agree that 
someone who is baptized apart from repentance and faith would be lost. This 
further highlights the concept found in both Old Testament and New, that it is 
the heart that matters, but that the heart shows itself outwardly. 
Incidentally, we'll save the thief on the cross for later.</p>
<p>So we might also 
conclude that it is possible to be a secret believer (for a time; I do not 
believe this can be permanent). Take Joseph of Arimathea in <b>John 19:38</b>; he was 
a secret "disciple," which means he was a follower of Christ. Yet he was NOT 
publicly declaring his faith. Yet the text presents him as a good man and a 
believer. <b>John 19:38</b> reads: "Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of 
Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the 
Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away."</p>
<p>We see the same 
situation in <b>Acts 2</b>, the idea of repentance (turn from sin and turning toward 
Christ) and baptism (publicly confessing Christ). But what saves a person is 
being rightly related to Jesus Christ, of which both baptism (when understood as 
a clear command of Christ) and confession with the mouth are evidences. But it 
seems Joseph was saved, even though he did not confess with his mouth.</p>
<p><b>Now if one holds to 
an Arminian viewpoint and a Campbellite viewpoint at the same time, you can see 
that if one lost his salvation and therefore becomes unregenerate, he would 
logically have to be baptized again to restore his salvation.</b>
If you concluded otherwise, then either it is impossible to lose 
one's salvation or baptism is not absolutely essential to the new birth.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn72">Question: Why Wasn't This Question in the Early 
Church Raised in Scripture: "Is Baptism Essential to Salvation? Can One Be 
Saved Without Being Baptized?"</a></b></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> This question 
was probably not raised because the early church was concerned with making 
disciples, not merely seeing people saved from hell. Since baptism is a 
necessary part of discipleship, the question of when the threshold of salvation 
occurred was not a concern.</p>
<p>Another possible answer 
was that this matter was made clear by the Apostles and their teaching. For 
example, Paul seems to state in <b>Ephesians 2</b> that believers were born lost in sin, 
that God resurrected them spiritually (regeneration) as a sovereign act, and one 
result of this quickening (regeneration) was faith in Jesus Christ followed by a 
life of good works 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph2810.htm')" target=_self class=pop>2:8-10</a>).</p>
<p>What has made the issue 
more complicated is the debate over mode and time of baptism. Since the 
apostles could authoritatively tell the early church, "baptism by immersion 
after faith," anybody that truly wanted to serve Jesus Christ would naturally 
follow Him in baptism. </p>
<p>When false modes 
(sprinkling or pouring) and erroneous timing (infant) for baptism came into 
play, it confused the New Testament pattern. So now we have people who view 
themselves as baptized because they were sprinkled as a baby. If these 
individuals come to trust in the work of Jesus Christ for their salvation but 
retain their erroneous teaching about baptism's mode and timing, are they truly 
saved? The early church never had to address this issue because of the presence 
and authority of the apostles at that time and the Jewish tradition of baptism 
that was well established.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn73">Mark 16:9-20</a></b></p>
<p><b>Mark 16:9-20</b> are verses 
left out of the earliest manuscripts. Although it is possible that this text 
was in the originals and left out, I tend to "camp" on the shorter readings, 
recognizing at the same time that those questionable verse might, in fact, be 
the Word of God. I have included the NIV introductory note:</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>9</sup> [The most reliable early manuscripts and other ancient 
witnesses do not have <b>Mark 16:9-20</b>.] When Jesus rose early on the first day of 
the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven 
demons. <sup>10</sup> She went and told those who had been with him and who 
were mourning and weeping. <sup>11</sup> When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had 
seen him, they did not believe it. </p>
<p><sup>12</sup> Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two 
of them while they were walking in the country. <sup>13</sup> These returned and reported it to the rest; but they 
did not believe them either. </p>
<p><sup>14</sup> Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were 
eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to 
believe those who had seen him after he had risen. </p>
<p><sup>15</sup> He said to them, &quot;Go into all the world and preach 
the good news to all creation. <sup>16</sup> <b>Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved</b>,
<b><u>but whoever does not believe will be condemned</u></b>.<u><b> </b> </u><sup>17</sup> And these signs will accompany those who believe: In 
my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; <sup>18</sup> they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when 
they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their 
hands on sick people, and they will get well.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>19</sup> After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken 
up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God. <sup>20</sup> Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, 
and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that 
accompanied it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will address this 
section because it might actually be legitimate Scripture. I appreciate the 
teaching of these verses because it makes my point exactly: the Bible labels a 
man lost NOT because he hasn't been baptized, but because he hasn't believed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The promise that "he 
who believes and is baptized will be saved" is just as firm as, "whoever does 
not believe will be condemned." If, as Campbellites assert, this verse teaches 
that only those who believe AND are baptized are saved, we now have to come up 
with some sort of limbo or purgatory for those who are "not condemned" because 
they are not unbelievers, but have not been baptized and are therefore not 
saved. So we have an in-between category sandwiched between those who are saved 
and those who are condemned, "Not condemned but not saved." Yet, if we use the 
same logic that the proponents of Campbellism use, this is indeed where we are 
left.</p>
<p>If people were labeled 
"saved" in Mark's Gospel without baptism, then, in a sense, the question is 
answered by precedent in the Gospel itself. Is there such the case? How about 
<b>Mark 2:5</b>, where Jesus said this to the man lowered from the roof: &quot;When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, 
'Son, your sins are forgiven.'&quot; No mention 
of baptism here. So, based on previous precedent in the Gospel of Mark itself, 
the example was set that baptism and salvation are two separate but related 
issues, and that the forgiveness of sins is possible by faith apart from 
baptism.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn74">1 Peter 3:20-21</a></b></p>
<p>Peter's verse is the 
key to unlock the entire issue. <b>1 Peter 3:20-21</b> is making a comparison to Noah 
and his family being saved in the ark through the flood of water in the context 
of an involved passage: "...who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the 
days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in 
all, were saved through water, and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves 
you also--<b>not the removal of dirt from the body</b> <b><u>but the pledge of a 
good conscience toward God.</u></b> It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus 
Christ....&quot;</p>
<p>On the one hand, Peter 
clearly states that baptism saves a person, but then he backtracks and makes it 
clear that it is <b><u>not</u></b> the ritual of baptism that actually saves a 
person, but the <i>repentant attitude</i> of the person who submits himself to 
baptism.</p>
<p><b>Here we see evidence 
for the argument that the term "baptism" is often used for the whole process of 
conversion, with baptism being the "formalization of conversion"</b> as it was 
considered in first century Judaism.</p>
<p>JUST AS SACRIFICES IN 
THE OLD TESTAMENT COULD NOT CLEANSE THE SOUL BUT MADE ONE CLEAN FOR COMMUNITY 
LIFE (<b>Hebrews 10:4</b>, "because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and 
goats to take away sins") AND PARTICIPATION 
IN THE LIFE OF ISRAEL, SO BAPTISM CANNOT CLEANSE THE CONSCIENCE OR SOUL, BUT 
WAS USED BY THE CHURCH TO DETERMINE WHO WAS RECOGNIZED AS "CLEAN" AND OPEN FOR 
FULL PARTICIPATION WITHIN THE CHURCH COMMUNITY.</p>
<p>Like <b>Psalm 51</b>,
"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, 
you will not despise...." so Peter tells us 
that what happens on the inside before baptism is the real issue, but baptism is 
crucial for the believer because it "saves us" on the outside (i.e., the church 
now recognizes the believer as one of their own and we are categorized among 
those who profess to follow Christ).</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn75">Acts 8:15-17</a></b></p>
<blockquote><sup>15</sup> When they arrived, they 
prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, <sup>16</sup> because the Holy Spirit had 
not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of 
the Lord Jesus. <sup>17</sup> Then Peter and John placed 
their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</blockquote>
<p>
The Book of Acts offers very little 
consistency at all regarding the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Sometimes the 
Holy Spirit came upon people when they believed, before they were baptized (see 
<b>Acts 10:44ff</b> below), other times when they were baptized, and other times when 
the apostles laid hands upon them. <i>This is one reason I think it is foolish 
to build a paradigm upon the book of Acts, unless the paradigm is that there is 
no consistent paradigm!</i></p>
<p>Since <b>Acts</b> is a book of transition, these 
passages can be explained in great detail, but I will not dive into that here. 
But note my logic:</p>
<ol type=1><li> Only saved believers possess and are baptized by the Spirit.</p>
<p><li> If there is one instance in the book of <b>Acts</b> where people receive the 
	Holy Spirit before they are baptized, then they were saved before being 
	baptized and the matter is settled.</p>
<p><li> There is such an instance,</p></ol>
<p><b><a name="sctn76">Acts 10:44-48</a></b></p>
<blockquote>While Peter was still speaking 
these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The circumcised 
believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy 
Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in 
tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, &quot;Can anyone keep these people from 
being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.&quot; 
So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus 
Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.</blockquote>
<p>The instance of the salvation of the thief 
on the cross apart from baptism coupled with the instance of <b>Acts 10</b> makes an 
awful good case for salvation apart from baptism, at least in my book.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the book of Acts 
minimizes water baptism and exalts Spirit baptism. <b>Acts 1:5</b> reads, "For John 
baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy 
Spirit.&quot; <b>Acts 11:16</b> &quot;Then I remembered 
what the Lord had said: 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with 
the Holy Spirit.'&quot; </p>
<p>It is Spirit baptism that uniquely 
distinguishes the believer from others, not water baptism. Anyone can baptize 
with water, but only the Savior can baptize with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn77">Acts 22:13-16</a></b></p>
<p><b>NIV Acts 9:9-19</b></p>
<blockquote><p><sup>9</sup> For three days he [Saul] 
was blind, and did not eat or drink anything. </p>
<p><sup>10</sup> In Damascus there was a 
disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, &quot;Ananias!&quot; &quot;Yes, 
Lord,&quot; he answered. </p>
<p><sup>11</sup> The Lord told him, &quot;Go to 
the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, 
for he is praying. <sup>12</sup> In a vision he has seen a 
man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>13</sup> &quot;Lord,&quot; Ananias answered, 
&quot;I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your 
saints in Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup> And he has come here with 
authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>15</sup> But the Lord said to 
Ananias, &quot;Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the 
Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel. <sup>16</sup> I will show him how much 
he must suffer for my name.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>17</sup> Then Ananias went to the 
house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, &quot;Brother Saul, the 
Lord--Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent 
me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&quot; <sup>18</sup> Immediately, something 
like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was 
baptized, <sup>19</sup> and after taking some 
food, he regained his strength. </p>
		<p>Saul spent several days with the disciples in 
Damascus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now for a second account at a later time:</p>
<p><b>NIV Acts 22:13-16</b></p>
<blockquote><p><sup>13</sup> He stood beside me and 
said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very moment I was able to 
see him. </p>
<p><sup>14</sup> &quot;Then he said: 'The God of 
our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to 
hear words from his mouth. <sup>15</sup> You will be his witness to 
all men of what you have seen and heard. <sup>16</sup> And now what are you 
waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.'</p></blockquote>
</p>
<p>This passage seems to imply that Saul 
washed away his sins through baptism and is a formidable argument for the 
Campbellite view.</p>
<p>Note the following:</p>
<p>Before Saul receives his sight, Ananias 
refers to him as "Brother Saul," an implication that Saul is already saved. The 
earlier account reads: 
<blockquote><sup>17</sup> Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. 
Placing his hands on Saul, he said, &quot;Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus, who appeared 
to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see 
again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&quot; <sup>18</sup> Immediately, 
something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up 
and was baptized.</p></blockquote>
<p>This raises the question of when the Holy 
Spirit came upon him. The most natural understanding would be that this 
occurred when Ananias placed his hands on Saul and the scales fell from his 
eyes, before he was baptized. Those two inferences (Brother Saul) and receiving 
the Spirit would lead us to believe Saul was already saved.</p>
<p>Yet the second passage seems to say that it 
was not until his baptism that Saul's sins were washed away</span>, "And now 
what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling 
on his name.'"</p>
<p>One solution offered by we non-Campbellites 
is to associate the washing away of sin with the phrase, "calling on his name." 
The Common Greek of the first century was filled with participles (unlike 
English, participles in Greek include our English gerunds and sometimes even 
commands).</p>
<p>We could easily understand this as, "be 
baptized, "and "wash your sins away (by) calling on his name," two separate 
acts. This is a very legitimate possibility grammatically and has its merits.</p>
<p>I prefer to believe that Saul was already 
truly "Brother Saul" before his baptism and had received the Holy Spirit when 
Ananias laid his hands upon him. Again, I prefer to think of baptism as the 
outward formalization of his conversion, much like the Lord's Supper does not 
recreate Calvary but pictures it. Baptism washes away our sins in the same way 
that the bread is Christ's body and the cup His blood; it pictures what has 
already transpired. Paul's baptism was the confession of his faith and outwardly 
identified him with both the Lord Jesus Christ and the Church. He was taking a 
stand for Jesus. Paul was converted on the Road to Damascus, but his salvation 
was formalized (certified) through baptism.</p>
<p><b><a name="sctn78">Romans 6:3-4</a></b></p>
<blockquote>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus 
	were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through 
	baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead 
	through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</blockquote>
<p>This passage is understood by some to refer 
to Spirit baptism. I do not think that is the most natural understanding, and I 
would add that many people miss the point Paul is making completely.</p>
<p>Because salvation does not depend upon our 
works, the question is logically raised, "Shall we sin that grace may abound?" 
If God is glorified by saving us graciously, then why not sin like crazy so God 
can forgive us more and He receive more glory? The question makes sense.</p>
<p>Paul's answer is not that we can lose our 
salvation (which is what an Arminian would answer), but that we were buried with 
Christ in baptism.</p>
<p>When we go into the water, we are buried 
with Him. When we come up, we are resurrected with Him. We are, therefore, 
committed to living a resurrection life.</p>
<p>Paul's point is this: we know it is not 
God's will for us to live in sin because God makes it clear through the ritual 
of baptism. What is missed by most is the idea that our baptism is a constant 
object lesson that our old life is to be buried and we are to live as a new 
creation.</p>
<p>That baptism symbolizes these things 
becomes quite clear because the whole passage is not to be taken literally. We 
are not LITERALLY buried with Christ, nor did we LITERALLY come back to life 
with Christ. We may be legally (in God's eyes) buried and resurrected with 
Christ, but literally it did not happen this way; we were not even born.</p>
<p>Still, it could be argued that this legal 
or positional death and resurrection with Christ, though non-literal, is 
affected by literal water baptism. <u><b>I would argue that baptism is for our 
benefit and for the church's, not for our relationship to God.</b></u> We are 
buried, visibly, through baptism. We are resurrected, visibly, through baptism. 
When we are tempted to sin that grace may abound, we look at our baptism. <i>It 
is a forgotten tool in our war against sin</i>. We saw earlier in 
<b>Ephesians 2</b> 
that God regenerates us before we believe and so that believe. The Spirit, like 
the wind, blows where He wills and causes the elect to be born again 
(<b>John 3</b>).
</p>
<p>Like Old Testament imagery and rituals, 
there is a distinction between substance and image. Human beings are image 
oriented, and we need something tangible to hang on to. The New Birth is 
invisible, so is the baptism by the Spirit; but water baptism is visible and can 
be etched on the mind.</p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn8">Can People Who Believe That &quot;One Has To Be 
Baptized in Order To Be Saved" Be Themselves Regenerate, Since They Are Trusting 
in a Work (Christ Plus Something Else)?</a></p>
<p>Is this like the 
Galatian Judaizers who had "fallen from grace" because they added circumcision 
to the Gospel?</p>
<p>This is a tough 
question indeed. At times like this, I defer to the doctrine of election. How 
clear of a Gospel is needed for a person to be saved? I think the elect can 
accept Christ and still be somewhat confused or, better yet, inconsistent. I 
have often wondered how saved people can remain within Catholicism, for example, 
with its bowing down to images and offering prayers (and other acts of worship) 
to Mary. These things are so overtly wrong in Scripture, yet I am convinced 
that there are many believers within those ranks as well.</p>
<p>I think there are 
people who somehow trust in Christ and not their works to make them right with 
God in both of these groupings, sometimes despite what they are taught. There 
is often a difference between what people agree to and what they really believe, 
deep down (what I call the funeral home test).</p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="sctn9">A Correct Presentation of Salvation</a></p>
<p>I have demonstrated the 
wealth of verses declaring faith (belief) or faith and repentance as the grounds 
for salvation and contrasted them to the small number of verses used to support 
the idea of faith plus baptism as the grounds for salvation. </p>
<p>Is God intentionally 
misleading people with the very Gospel emphasizing personal salvation, John's 
Gospel? Yet that Gospel states time and time again that it is faith that saves 
us.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of my 
explanation as to salvation (right off our church's web page):</p>

<p id="pgt">How To Be Saved</p>

<p>To be saved means &quot;to be delivered or rescued.&quot; In this context, we
are talking about being delivered from sin and its penalty. Simply put, to be
saved means to be right with God, the consequence of which is eternal life in
heaven.</p>
<p>We are born separated from God and lost in our sins. Shortly before Jesus was
born, an angel appeared to Joseph and said, &quot;...you shall call his name
Jesus, for it is he who will save his people from their sins...&quot; (<b>Matthew
1:21</b>).</p>
<p>To be saved means to be transferred from God's disfavor to God's favor.&nbsp;
It
means becoming part of His Kingdom. It means a new, God-centered life.&nbsp;
It means
escaping the fear of hell and obtaining the assurance of heaven.</p>
<p align="center"><b>How Can We Be Saved?</b></p>
<p><b>In order to be saved, we must:</b></p>
<ol>
  <b><li>Want to be saved. This is called repentance. To repent means to change
one's mind. If you want to be delivered (saved) from a sinful, self-centered
life and you want God to work in your life, you are well on your way.</b>
<p>&quot;Repent therefore and return, that your sins may be wiped away...&quot;
(<b>Acts 3:19</b>)
<p>This does not mean you must reform your life to be saved. It does mean you
want God to reform your life. You are open to His working. God is no longer an
enemy to keep at bay. Instead, He becomes the center of your life.</p>
<p>Repentance, as a change of mind, can occur in a split second (even though God
often prepares a person over time).</p>
  <b><li>Understand the basis of salvation: the work of Jesus Christ. Jesus is both
God and man. The Bible says, &quot;Unto us a Son is given, and his name shall be
called, 'Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace....'&quot;
(Isaiah 9:6).
    </b>
<p>Jesus came to die on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins. He died to pay
our penalty so that God could forgive us.</p>
<p>&quot;...Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures...&quot; (<b>I
Corinthians 15:3</b>) &quot;...Christ died for us. How much more then, having now been
justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through
Him.&quot; (<b>Romans 5:8b-9</b>)</p>
<p>After Christ died, He rose again, evidencing that He is the Son of God and
that His payment for sin was effective.</p>
  <b><li>We must depend upon what Christ did for us to make us right with God.&nbsp;
    A
check is only &quot;potential&quot; until it is cashed. The work of Christ is
only &quot;potential&quot; until we believe. He died for everyone, but only
those who exercise faith experience the benefits of Christ's sacrifice.
    </b>
<p>We cannot obtain God's forgiveness by living a good life or by doing our
best. No one does his or her best all the time anyhow. Besides, we already owe
God everything&#151;how can we give Him more than our all?</p>
<p>Good works or rituals cannot save us.</p>
<p>&quot;He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in
righteousness, but according to his mercy...&quot; (<b>Titus 3:5a</b>)</p>
<p>To be saved, we must stop trying to earn salvation. Jesus Christ is the
Savior. He saves. He does not help us to save ourselves. He does the saving!</p>
<p>&quot;...if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your
heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved...for whoever will
call upon the name of the Lord will be saved...&quot; (<b>Romans 10:9,11</b>)</p></ol>
<p align="center"><b>Would you like to call upon the Lord for salvation, to hold God to His Word?</b><br>
You might want to pray this model prayer:</p>
  <b>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear God, I know I am a sinner. I cannot make up for my sins. I believe Jesus
died as the sacrifice for my sin. He paid my penalty through His death on the
cross. I believe He rose again. I want to be saved from my sins.&nbsp;
I now claim the
promise of forgiveness and eternal life through my Savior. By faith I claim the
salvation you offer. Thank you for saving me. In Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>

<p>Man-centered Theology

<p>Human Reasoning and

<p>Every Religion, except

<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="appendix2">Appendix 2: The Immutability and Aseity of God</a></p>
<p><b>The Immutablity of God </b>(topical)</p>

<p><i>Introduction</i></p>

<ol type=1><li><p>When it comes to matters of theology, most dictionaries do not recognize
  the vocabulary.</p>
<li><p>Take two words we will use today: aseity and immutability. Only my large
  3 volume dictionary has those words. You can check yours when you get home.</p>
<li><p>But why do we use such words? To impress people (who are we impressing)?
  To keep theology from average Christians? No.</p>
<li><p>We use these words to save breath, in the name of efficiency.</p>
<li><p>Aseity means that God is self-derived, self-sufficient, and independent
  of His creation. He depends upon us for nothing, and we cannot alter Who He
  is. This leads us into today’s subject.</p>
<li><p>Today’s topic will focus upon the immutability of God.</p>
<li><p>These matters are all being challenged today; we Christians need to
  decide whether we believe in the clearly infinite God of a Scripture or the
  toned-down, weak versions of God being proposed today on all fronts, within
  and without evangelicalism. You need to pay attention to what you are
  hearing in this series, because you need to know what and why you believe
  what you do; <b><u>it will be challenged, eventually even by people who will attend
this church.</u></b></p>
<p>There are people out there today, claiming to be Christians and many
  claiming to believe the Bible, who would challenge every one of my main
  points today.
<li><p>Immutability sounds bad. If someone called you immutable, you might
  punch them in the nose. The truth is that this mysterious word is true only
  of God.</p>
<li><p>To be immutable is to always be the same, unalterable. God is unchanging
  and unchangeable. <b>James 1:17</b> says, &quot;Every good and perfect gift is from 
above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change 
like shifting shadows.&quot;</p>
<li><p>We can insert the word &quot;always&quot; to highlight this truth. God is <b>always</b>
  holy, <b>always</b> sovereign, <b>always</b> good, <b>always</b> wise, <b>always</b> just, and
<b>always</b>
  gracious. Whatever God is, he&nbsp;<b><u>always</u></b> is. His nature is an
<b>always</b> nature. He
  always is Who He is.</p>
</ol>

  <p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>The Immutability of God Explains Why We Can Depend Upon God, and
  Why God Is Worthy of Our Worship and Our Submission.</u></p>
<p>God’s immutability extends to many areas. Let’s look at a few
  key areas in which God is immutable.</p>
<ol type=I>
	<li>
	<p><b>God Is Immutable In Regards to His Very Nature; He is Like A Rock.</b></p>
		<ol type=A>
			<li><p>Most changes are for the better or worse...</p>
			<li><p>God is perfect; perfection cannot be improved upon, therefore if 
			God changed, it would have to be a change for the worse...</p>
			<ol type=1><li><p>The Christian life involves change; we change as we are
  conformed to His image....but His image does not change...</p>
  <li><p>People who are not wanting to grow and change have a
  problem, often insecurity; but if God changed, that would be a
  problem.</p>
		</ol><li><p>That God does not change in His substance is clear in Scripture:</p>
		<p>NIV <b>Psalms 102:24-27</b></p>
		<blockquote><sup>24</sup>&nbsp;So I said: &quot;Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my
days; your years go on through all generations.<br><sup>25</sup>&nbsp;In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens
  are the work of your hands.<br><sup>26</sup>&nbsp;They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.
  Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.<br><sup>27</sup>&nbsp;<b><u>But you remain the same</u></b>, and your years will never end....&quot;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>NIV <b>Malachi 3:6</b>
		<blockquote>
			<p><u><b>I the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> do not change</b></u>. So you, O descendants of Jacob,
  are not destroyed.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<li>Even during the incarnation, God remained the same in substance...the 
		nature of God remained the same, though His plan unfolded and a new 
		phase of it was initiated...<p></p>
		<p>Bill Irwin, a man who is blind, has a talking computer he uses to study the
  Bible. He’s had a few chuckles over some of the pronunciations. &quot;For a long
time,&quot; Bill says, &quot;the computer pronounced Holy Bible as ’holly bibble’
  until I figured out how to modify it.&quot; But there was one thing Bill couldn’t
  change. The computer uses the Spanish pronunciation for Jesus Christ—HEYsus
  Krist. &quot;The programmer is Hispanic,&quot; Bill told me with a smile, &quot;and he made
  sure that HEYsus Krist cannot be altered.&quot;</p>
		<p>I like that. It reminds me that among the things in life that can be changed
  to suit my taste, one remains tamper-resistant—I can’t change Jesus.</p>
		<li>One frequent picture of God is a Rock. Although technically rocks can
  wear away from tides and currents, they are about the most unchangeable and
  dependable objects we encounter. Since God is the same, He is truly a Rock
  upon which we can build.<p></p>
		<p>NIV <b>Psalms 18:2</b>
		<blockquote>
			<p>The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God
  is my rock, in whom I take refuge. He is my shield and the horn of my
  salvation, my stronghold.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>NIV <b>Psalms 40:2</b>
		<blockquote>
			<p>He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire;
  he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.</p>

<li><b>God Is Immutable In His Purpose and Wisdom.</b><p>
<ol type=A><li>Although God seems to change His mind when interacting with people, He
  does not. First, let me present some clear verses that state that God does
  not actually change His mind:<p></p>
<p>NIV <b> Numbers 23:19</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man,
  that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he
  promise and not fulfill?</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>NIV <b> 1 Samuel 15:29</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is
  not a man, that he should change his mind.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>NIV <b> Psalms 33:11</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>But the plans of the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> stand firm forever, the purposes
  of his heart through all generations.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>NIV <b> Isaiah 46:10</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient
  times, what is still to come. I say: My purpose will stand, and I will do
  all that I please.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p>NIV <b> Romans 11:29</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>For God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.</p>
  </blockquote>
<li>Now the immutability of God has often been defended in one breath but
  denied in another; example: replacement theology teaches that God is done
  with Israel forever, even though God has made it abundantly clear that He
  has plans for Israel in the end times....Others say that homosexuality is
  permissible in our age...and on and on...<li>There are verses that make it 
		look like God changes His mind, but they are examples of God relating to 
		men as though a man...<p></p>
<p>NIV <b> Genesis 6:6-7</b>
<blockquote>
  <p><sup>6</sup> The L<span class=sm>ORD</span> was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was
  filled with pain.<br>
	<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;So the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> said, &quot;I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the
  face of the earth—men and animals, and creatures that move along the
  ground, and birds of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>NIV <b>Exodus 32:14</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>Then the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> relented and did not bring on his people the
  disaster he had threatened.</p>
  </blockquote>
<p><b>Jonah 3:10</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil
  ways, he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had
  threatened.</p>
  </blockquote>
<li>This is technically called &quot;Anthropopatheia&quot;, but causually referred to
  as condescension. According Ethelbert Bullinger in his classic volume, &quot;Figures of Speech Used in the Bible,&quot; anthropopetheia is, 
&quot;the ascription
  of human passions, actions, or attributes to God.&quot; Bullinger adds, &quot;The 
Hebrews had a name for this figure, and called it Derech Benai Adam, the way of 
the sons of man.&quot;<p>
<li>For example, we read about the mighty hand of the Lord, or His eyes that
  see all, His ears that hear all, his smelling the sweet savor of a
  sacrifice, using the earth as His footstool, or of God girding up His loins.
  So the text describes Him as changing His mind. <b><u>What this really means is
  that God changed His attitude in response to man’s change toward Him; this
  does not mean that God was surprised, or that He altered His plans.</u></b> His
  plans, rather, took into account what He knew would happen.<li><b>Malachi 3:6</b>&nbsp;

<ol type=A><li>God cannot learn something: He is perfect in knowledge; He has all

Is your God unchangeable? Is He limited in what He knows?

<blockquote>&quot;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,&quot;

<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="appendix3">Appendix 3: WHY WE EXIST: 
TO GLORIFY GOD</a></p>
<p>
<b>
</span>Main Idea:</b> <u>Glorifying God Is Central to Everything About 
Everything.<b><br>
<br>
</b>
</u>Today, I will try to offer Scriptural evidence that leads us to 
believe that the purpose of God's Creation, His Choice of Israel, and the Church 
primarily exist to bring glory to His Name, that glorifying God is indeed the 
big, overall category under which all the pieces of the puzzle are given 
meaning. Then I will show how Glorifying the Name of God is the foundation of 
prayer and the plan of salvation.</p>
<p>There is no verse that says, 
"All creation exists to glorify God." I do think we can, nonetheless, offer a 
strong argument that creation does exist to bring glory to God. See if you 
agree with me after reading my sermon outline and the texts spelled out.<br>
<br>
<ol type=I><li><b>All Exist To Glorify God.</b><br>
<br>
	<b>Romans 5:2</b> "through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which 
we now stand. And we rejoice in <b><u>the hope of the glory of God</u></b>."<br>
<br>
<ol type=A><li>God is not &quot;codependent.&quot; (He does not have an empty love tank.)<br>
<br>
<li>Glorifying God means acknowledging and in some way displaying His splendor.<br>
<br>
<li><b>Psalm 19</b> begins with creation in general and then focuses in on us as individuals. (turn there)</p>
<blockquote><p>The heavens <b><u>declare the glory of God</u></b>; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. 
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. 
There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. Their voice goes 
out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he 
has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from 
his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at one end 
of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its 
heat. </p>
<p>The law of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> is 
perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> are trustworthy, making 
wise the simple. </p>
<p>The precepts of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> are 
right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> are radiant, giving 
light to the eyes. The fear of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> is pure, enduring forever. The 
ordinances of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> are sure and altogether righteous. They are more 
precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey 
from the comb. By them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great 
reward. Who can discern his errors? Forgive my hidden faults. Keep your 
servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then will I be 
blameless, innocent of great transgression. May the words of my mouth and the 
meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, my Rock and my 
Redeemer.</p></blockquote>
<ol type=1><li><p>This idea of declaring God's glory: before the angels, before the Persons of 
the Trinity</p>
<li><p>John Piper writes,
&quot;if God wants to love us infinitely and delight us fully and eternally, he must 
preserve for us the one thing that will satisfy us totally and eternally; 
namely, the presence and worth of his own glory. He alone is the source of full 
and lasting pleasure. Therefore, his commitment to uphold and display his glory 
is not vain, but virtuous. God is the one being for whom self-exaltation is an 
infinitely loving act&quot; (<u>Pleasures of God</u>, p. 282).</p></p>
<li><p>We, as individuals, glorify God by our words and thoughts! (<b>Psalm 19:14</b>) 
--the real battle is how well we glorify God--</ol></p>
<li>Let's look at why God choose Israel<p>
<b>Isaiah 43:6-7</b> &quot;I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 
'Do 
not hold them back.' Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of 
the earth--everyone who is called by my name, <b><u>whom I created for my glory</u></b>, 
whom I formed and made.&quot; <p>
<b>Isaiah 60:21</b> &quot;Then will all your people be righteous and they will possess the 
land forever. They are the shoot I have planted, the work of my hands, <b><u>for 
the display of my splendor</u></b>.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Isaiah 61:3</b> &quot;and provide for those who grieve in Zion--to bestow on them a 
crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a 
garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of 
righteousness, a planting of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> <b><u>for the display of his splendor</u></b>.&quot;<br>
<br>
<li>Let's look at why God chose us<p>
<b>Ephesians 1:5-6</b> &quot;he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus 
Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will--<b><u>to the praise of his 
glorious grace</u></b>, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.&quot; <p>
<b>Ephesians 1:12</b> &quot;In order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might <b>
<u>be for the praise of his glory</u></b>.&quot;
<li>Let's look at why God keeps us saved:<p>
<b>Ephesians 1:14</b> &quot;[The Holy Spirit] who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance 
until the redemption of those who are God's possession--<b><u>to the praise of 
his glory</u></b>.&quot;<p>
<li>Let's look at why God the Son created all things, why the human nature of 
Christ was holy and pure, and why Jesus is the head of the church:<p>
<b>Colossians 1:16-18</b> &quot;For by him all things were created [God the Son]: things in 
heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers 
or authorities; all things were created by him and for him. He is before all 
things, and in him all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the 
church [Jesus]; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, <b>
<u>so that in everything he might have the supremacy</u></b>. </p>
<li><p>God is not some reactionary weakling, panicked and taken by surprise, 
desperately trying to control people through threats and zapping, frantically 
trying to fix a creation defiled and diseased by sin.<p>
He warns out of goodness, He had a plan for redemption before the world began. 
This drama called life is all part of that plan. The purpose of it all: to bring 
Him glory and to include others in celebrating and acknowledging His wonderful 
nature.<p>
<b>Revelation 13:8</b> &quot;All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast--all whose 
names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was 
slain from the creation of the world.&quot; <p>
Glorifying God is central to everything about everything.</ol>
<p>
<li><b>Glorifying God Focuses Upon 
Bringing Honor and Fame to His Name.<p>
</b>
<ol type=A><li>There are so many verses about this: <p>
<b>1 Samuel 12:22</b> &quot;<u><b>For the sake of his great name</b></u> the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> will not 
reject his people, because the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> was pleased to make you his own.&quot;<p>
<b>1 Peter 2:9</b> &quot;But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a 
people belonging to God, <b><u>that you may declare the praises of him</u></b> 
who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.&quot;<p>
<b>2 Samuel 7:23-26</b> &quot;And who is like your people Israel--the one nation on earth 
that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and <b><u>to make a name 
for himself</u></b>, And now, L<span class="sm">ORD</span> God, keep forever the promise you have made 
concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised, <b><u>so that your 
name will be great forever</u></b>. Then men will say, 'The L<span class="sm">ORD</span> Almighty is God 
over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established before 
you.&quot; </p>
<p><b>Romans 9:17</b> &quot;For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: 'I raised you up for this very 
purpose, that I might display my power in you and <b><u>that my name might be 
proclaimed</u></b> in all the earth.'&quot; </p>
<p><b>Isaiah 63:11-14</b> &quot;Then his people recalled the days of old, the days of Moses 
and his people-- they were given rest by the Spirit of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>. This is how you 
guided your people <b><u>to make for yourself a glorious name</u></b>.&quot;<p>
<b>Ezekiel 39:25</b> &quot;Therefore this is what the Sovereign L<span class="sm">ORD</span> says: I will now bring 
Jacob back from captivity and will have compassion on all the people of Israel, 
and I will <b><u>be zealous for my holy name</u></b>. </p>
<p><b>Isaiah 48:9-11</b> &quot;<b><u>For my own name's sake</u></b> I delay my wrath; for the 
sake of my praise I hold it back from you, so as not to cut you off. See, I have 
refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of 
affliction. For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. <u><b>How can I let 
myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another. </b> 
</u></p>
<li><p>Our prayers and arguments before God should argue the case of glorifying His 
Name (in Jesus' Name).</p>
<p><b>Joshua 7:8-9</b> &quot;O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its 
enemies? The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this 
and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. <b><u>What then 
will you do for your own great name</u></b>?&quot; <p>
<b>Psalms 25:11</b> &quot;<b><u>For the sake of your name</u></b>, O L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, forgive my 
iniquity, though it is great.&quot; <p>
<b>Psalms 79:9</b> &quot;Help us, O God our Savior, <u><b>for the glory of your name</b></u>; 
deliver us and forgive our sins for your name's sake.&quot; <p>
<li>Forgiveness and evangelism are for His Name's sake<p>
<b>1 John 2:12</b> &quot;I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven <u>
<b>on account of his name</b></u>.&quot;<p>
<b>Psalms 23:3</b> &quot;He restores my soul. He guides me in paths of righteousness <b><u>
for his name's sake</u></b>.&quot; <p>
<b>Romans 1:5</b> &quot;Through him and <b><u>for his name's sake</u></b>, we received grace 
and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that 
comes from faith.&quot; <p>
<b>Acts 21:13</b> &quot;Then Paul answered, &quot;Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am 
ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem <b><u>for the name of 
the Lord Jesus</u></b>.&quot; <p>
<b>3 John 1:5-8</b> &quot;Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the 
brothers, even though they are strangers to you.
They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on 
their way in a manner worthy of God. It was <b><u>for the sake of the Name</u></b> 
that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans. We ought therefore to 
show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth.&quot;<p>
Glorifying God is central to everything about everything.</p></ol>
<p><b>III. Salvation Was Brought About in a 
Way That Glorified God.<br>
<br>
</b>
<ol type=A><li><p><b>Romans 3:21-27</b> &quot;But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has 
been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness 
from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. <p>
There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 
and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ 
Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his 
blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had 
left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--he did it to demonstrate his 
justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those 
who have faith in Jesus. 
<p>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of 
observing the law? No, but on that of faith.&quot; <p>
<li>No human effort = God gets all the glory!<p>Most of us know 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/eph289.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, 
but we forget, &quot;lest any man should boast.&quot;<p><b>Isaiah 53:10</b> &quot;Yet it was the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>'s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, 
and though the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring 
and prolong his days, and the will of the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> will prosper in his hand.&quot; 
</p>
<p>Glorifying God is central to everything about everything.</p></ol>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
<ol type=1><li>Glorifying God is what it is all about.<br>
<li>Evangelism, discipleship, worship, conducting our family life God's way, 
employment, culture, arts, hobbies, sports, health, education--all those things 
should be submitted to the greater task of glorifying God.<br>
<li>We should not confuse WAYS we glorify God with the overall AIM of glorifying 
God in all we do.</p></ol></ol>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="appendix4">Appendix 4: The Integrity of a Written Doctrinal 
Position</a></p>
<p>When so many people and 
groups claim to believe the Bible, their claim tells us little. For example, 
Jehovah Witnesses, Mormons, and Seventh Day Adventists all claim to believe and 
align themselves with the teaching of Scripture.</p>
<p>If we are to truly 
discuss and even challenge one another's convictions, it is important to be 
upfront about them. This is only one reason why a written doctrinal statement 
makes sense. It is not enough to say, "I believe the Bible." That communicates 
very little. When I hear something like that, I think, "These folks are so 
embarrassed about what they believe or uncommitted to a set of beliefs, or they 
have such little unity that they want to conceal their beliefs."</p>
<p>Although this may not 
always be true, it often is the case. Written doctrinal statements are helpful 
communication tools, and they proclaim, "When we say we believe the Bible, we 
have concluded that the Bible teaches…."</p>
<p>We all have to draw the 
line as to where heresy begins. Better to do so upfront with a written 
statement than through a silent code. It is a matter of integrity.</p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="appendix5">Appendix 5: The Nature of Sin: Sins of Commission, 
Sins of Omission, and the Deeply Rooted Problem--Deceitful and Desperately 
Wicked Hearts</a></p>
<p><i><u>Why Arminianism 
must take a shallow view of sin.</u></i></p>
<p>The viewpoint that we 
have a completely free will and that we can attain sinlessness in this life 
often (not always) flows from an Arminian viewpoint. So is the viewpoint that a 
regenerate person can lose his salvation through sin or a series of sins. I 
have many objections to the Arminian perspective, one of which is the 
downplaying the nature of sin.</p>
<p>The idea that we can 
lose our salvation encourages a fake spirituality, legalism, and shallow 
doctrinal understanding because followers of this way of thinking are often 
obsessed with hanging onto their salvation.</p>
<p>Sins are therefore 
often called, "mistakes." Sin is also defined in a shallow fashion. For 
example, I can do a good deed for a wrong reason (to manipulate someone, for my 
ego, for my image or pride), thus polluting a good act with a sinful motive.</p>
<p>I do agree with some 
Arminians who recognize that all sins are NOT alike. Under the Law, for 
example, the penalty for some sins was death, for others a financial penalty, 
while other sins required only repentance and sacrifice. Although any sin would 
break the Law, which is an entire cohesive unit (see <b>James 2:10</b>,
"For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is 
guilty of breaking all of it") not all sins 
bear the same weight in Scripture (<b>John 19:11</b> reads, </span>"Jesus answered, 
'You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. 
Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a <b><u>greater</u></b> 
sin'").</p>
<p>In <b>1 Corinthians 5 and 
6</b>, Paul lists the types of sins requiring church discipline, and in <b>chapter 6</b> he 
lists the sins that typify the unregenerate, telling us that those professing 
believers who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God. Those 
of us who believe in salvation by grace and adhere to security argue that those 
whose lives are characterized by the sins of <b>1 Corinthians 6</b> are very likely not 
truly saved (not that a genuine believer cannot fall into serious sin for a 
time, but, like a boomerang, he will come back to repentance much like Peter 
after the Resurrection).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the 
Arminian position looks at sins as wrong acts or (better) wrong attitudes and 
thoughts. The problem, however, lies much deeper.</p>
<p><b>Jeremiah 17:9</b> says,
</span>"The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can 
understand it?"</p>
<p>Jesus said, </span>"For 
from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, 
murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and 
folly. All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean'&quot; 
in <b>Mark 7:21-23</b>.</p>
<p>We often are unaware of 
the many ways in which we sin. <b>John 1:7</b> offers some interesting implications: 
"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with 
one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin."</p>
<p>If we are "walking in 
the light," meaning living in fellowship with God, then the blood of Jesus 
"purifies us from all sin." But if we are walking in the light, what sins are 
there that need purification? The best answer is that we sin in ways we do not 
recognize, even when our walk with God is at full force!</p>
<p>As our attitudes are 
contaminated by ego and the desire for control; our heats deceive us and we lie 
to our own selves. We say we are not angry, just hurt when we are both. 
Although we receive a new nature when we receive Christ, we still battle our old 
nature, and it can be insidious and cause us to sabotage ourselves. Larry Crabb 
rightly points out that the biggest problem in marriage (and in any close 
relationship, for that matter) is "justified self-centeredness" (see <u>Men and 
Women, Enjoying the Difference</u>). Psychologists tell us we forgot almost all 
the wrong things we do, but we remember well the way others have wronged us. 
This is very much part of "deceitful heart syndrome." This is why Solomon tells 
us, "He who trusts in his own heart is a fool" (<b>Proverbs 28:26</b>).</p>
<p>We must recognize that 
there are sins of omission (things I fail to do that God wants me to do) and 
sins of commission (lines I cross against God's will). Those who believe in 
salvation by sin management usually downplay sins of omission. It is okay if I 
don't spend time with the kids or do not take time to treat my wife with 
gentleness or offer her my time, but if I would swear I would lose my 
salvation. When God wills for us to do something and we don't do it, that is 
every bit as much a sin as if He forbids us to do something but we choose to do 
it anyway. Failing to show love, for example, is a sin.</p>
<p>Another problem I have 
with the Arminian viewpoint is their selective use of Scripture. For example, 
if you could lose your salvation based on <b>Hebrews 6</b>, you could never be saved 
again. One thing is clear: whoever is being talked about here (a believer who 
loses his salvation or a fake believer) cannot be saved: <b>Hebrews 6:4-6</b> reads, "It is impossible for those who have 
once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the 
Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of 
the coming age, if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to 
their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him 
to public disgrace."</p>
<p>At the funeral home, 
every Arminian has somehow held onto his salvation, no matter what his 
lifestyle. The practical outworking of Arminianism is, "people I am not close to 
can lose their salvation, but no one near and dear to me will." I have no 
problem with understanding <b>Hebrews 6</b>: such people are with God's people, but not 
part of the elect. If they were, they 
could not have deserted the faith and wandered into apostasy: "They went out from us, but they did not really belong to 
us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their 
going showed that none of them belonged to us" (<b>1 John 2:19</b>).</p>
<p><b><u>If you had to be 
born again and again and again you should logically be baptized again and again 
and again</u></b>. Some Arminians do 
practice this; most do not.</p>
<p>Arminians do not excel 
in godliness over others, as measurable by divorce rate, personal debt, church 
splits, and other quantifiable statistics. Fear IS one major motivator in life, 
but it can also inhibit a believer from growing. From a practical viewpoint, 
the threat of losing one's salvation, statistically, does not reduce divorce, 
poor money management, or poor child rearing.</p>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="appendix6">Appendix 6: Collecting Criteria and Complicating 
Salvation: Where Do We Draw the Line?</a></p>
<p>Why do we draw the line 
at repentance and faith?</p>
<p>All of the following 
additional requirements could conceivably be added as requirements for salvation 
if the Bible is interpreted at a superficial level (rather than seeking to 
understand how the original audience would have understood these things):</p>
<ol class=1><li><p> Baptism (dealt with 
above)</p>
<li><p> Selling all one has 
and giving it all to the poor</p>
<p>NIV <b>Matthew 19:21</b> Jesus 
answered, &quot;If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the 
poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot; </p>
<p>NIV <b>Mark 10:21</b> Jesus looked 
at him and loved him. &quot;One thing you lack,&quot; he said. &quot;Go, sell everything you 
have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, 
follow me.&quot; </p>
<p>NIV <b>Luke 12:33-34</b></p>
<p><sup>33</sup> Sell your possessions and 
give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a 
treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no 
moth destroys. </p>
<p><sup>34</sup> For where your treasure 
is, there your heart will be also. </p>
<p>Like the baptism passage, the question, 
"What happens to someone who doesn't sell all his possessions but follows 
Christ?" In the first two quotations, Jesus was exposing the covetousness of 
the rich young ruler; the latter is often considered an exaggeration to get His 
followers to look at life through non-materialistic eyes, not as a literal 
command.</p>
<p>Those who consider we who do not believe 
baptism is necessary for salvation (but recognize that baptism is necessary for 
obedience) are often accused of ignoring the plain meaning of the text. Okay, 
let's see those who so accuse explain the texts above and explain why they do 
not make it a requirement for salvation. When they do so, they will sound a lot 
like the rest of us!</p>
<li><p> Exceeding the righteousness of the Pharisees</p>
<p><b>Matthew 5:20</b> could be 
easily construed to be an additional requirement of salvation: "For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses 
that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter 
the kingdom of heaven."</p>
<p>Although some Pharisees 
were hypocrites, most were very devout and sincere, like Paul the Apostle, as he 
himself describes in <b>Philippians 3:5-6</b></span>, "circumcised on the eighth day, 
of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in 
regard to the law, a Pharisee; as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for 
legalistic righteousness, faultless.&quot;</p>
<p>I think it would be 
appropriate to say that most Pharisees knew the Scriptures and had committed 
more verses to memory than almost all Christians in any denomination or belief 
system; they lived clean lives, were noted for family faithfulness and acts of 
charity and kindness. Like Paul, many of them passed the "legalistic 
righteousness" test; when they were measured against the law, they were not 
"highhanded" sinners, and they followed the Law's demands as far as atoning for 
their other (besides highhanded) sins and weaknesses. </p>
<p>Although we tend to 
think of the Pharisees who hated Christ, we need to remember that they were the 
powerful and often corrupt version. Far more Pharisees were like Nicodemus and 
Joseph of Arimathea than of the evil variety. Most followed the godly example 
of Hillel, one of Judaism's great Rabbis who lived shortly before the time of 
Christ. Jesus teachings often parallel his. For example, Hillel said, "If you 
don't want other people to do something to you, don't do it to them" (the Golden 
Rule stated in a different fashion). For documentation, see the chapters about 
the Pharisees in Dr. Ron Moseley's book, <u>Yeshua, A Guide to the Real Jesus 
and the Early Church.</u> </p>
<p>But is this what Christ 
is talking about? I think He is very clearly trying to wear people down to see 
how utterly lost and helpless they are. He actually intensifies the Law, 
showing us that we cannot find salvation through our works, no matter how hard 
we try. It is hopeless and vain, as Paul explains: <b>Romans 7:14</span></b>, 
"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to 
sin." That is where Jesus wanted to get 
folks, I believe.</p>
<li><p> Submitting to the 
Lordship of Christ/taking up the cross daily</p>
<p>Like many of the things 
mentioned before or after this point, it IS God's will for us to take up the 
cross daily (whatever that means) and submit to the Lordship (control and will) 
of Jesus Christ. But the question is, "Is my salvation dependent upon doing 
these things, or do these things flow as I grow after my salvation?"</p>
<p>If we must be willing 
to do anything God calls us to do in order to be saved (which is how living 
under the lordship of Christ is generally understood), then assurance of 
salvation is impossible. Yet, according to <b>1 John 5:13</b>, we can KNOW that we 
have eternal life: "I write these things to you who believe in the name of the 
Son of God so that you may <b><u>know</u></b> that you have eternal life."</p>
<p>Please understand this 
point: I cannot possibly <b>know</b> that I would do any thing God led me to do
<i>until </i>He actually asks me (and then I am tested). Peter, for example, 
thought he would never desert Christ. Note his words,
"Peter replied, 'Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.'" 
(<b>Matthew 26:33</b>). Yet that same night 
he denied Christ three times before the rooster crowed. </p>
<p>All we can know is that 
we <i>want</i> to be willing to do God's will, but we cannot ever know <i>if</i> 
we would do ANYTHING God told us to do unless He tested us in <i>every</i> area.</p>
<li><p> If we state that 
obeying every one of the Lord's commands is necessary for salvation, then it 
would be easy to conclude that traveling as a representative of Jesus Christ to 
foreign lands was necessary for salvation, for Jesus said,
</span>"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore <i>
go</i> and make disciples <i>of all nations</i>, baptizing them in the name of 
the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey 
everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very 
end of the age" (<b>Matthew 28:19-20</b>).</p>
<p>Most of us understand 
this as a task given to the church at large, not each individual Christian. 
Still, it could be argued that there are no limitations here. If we are looking 
for a collection of specific criteria about how to be saved apart from the clear 
and oft repeated "believe," then this idea is certainly a candidate.</p>
<li><p> Speaking in 
Tongues. Although I am skeptical about <b>Mark 16:9ff</b>, one could conclude that 
unless one spoke in tongues, he is not saved: </span>"And these signs will 
accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will 
speak in new tongues."</p>
<li><p> Picking up snakes. 
While we're collecting criteria, <b>Mark 16</b> also says that "these signs 
will accompany those who believe....They will pick up snakes with their hands.&quot;</p>
<li><p> Drinking poison (no, 
not your wife's coffee!), While we're collecting criteria, <b>Mark 16</b> also says 
that "these signs will accompany those who believe...when they drink 
deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick 
people, and they will get well.&quot;</p>
<li><p> Ability to heal 
others. While we're collecting criteria, <b>Mark 16</b> also says that "these 
signs will accompany those who believe...they will place their hands on sick 
people, and they will get well.&quot;</p>
<li><p> Working greater 
miracles than Jesus worked.
<b>John 14:12</b> reads, "I tell you 
the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do 
even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.&quot;</p>
<p>I am not sure I 
completely understand this verse's true meaning, but if I thought my salvation 
(which comes by faith) depended upon me working greater miracles than Jesus 
worked, I'd be in trouble. Yet because I believe in the oft repeated teaching 
that I am saved by faith in Christ, I know my salvation is secure whether I meet 
this condition or not.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, 
but here are just SOME other criteria that could be added: being perfect as the 
Father in heaven is perfect, holiness (perfection) without which no one will see 
God, undergoing persecution, pressing onward to attain the resurrection from the 
dead, being a peacemaker, cultivating meekness, receiving persecution, not 
eating meat sacrificed to idols, never eating food prepared with blood, no 
divorce or remarriage under any circumstances, receiving communion, must not be 
cowardly, receiving the anointing with oil and prayer from the elders, not 
committing the unpardonable sin, not calling a brother a "fool," and on and on 
it goes.</p>
<p>It seems to me a lot 
wiser approach to cling to the oft-repeated message of salvation by "repentance 
toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ." Once we are saved, "God works 
in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure." Faith is taking God at His 
word that, "He who believes in the Son has everlasting life." When God 
GENUINELY saves a person, that person evidences fruit, by which they are known.</p>
<p>We must embrace 
principles of interpretation that seek the plain meaning of a text but avoids 
being infantile by jumping to conclusions.</p></ol>
<li><p class="bighpc"><a name="conclusion">Conclusion</a></p>
<p>Thank you for 
journeying with me through this theological trail. As I stated in the 
beginning, if I have not persuaded you that my viewpoint is the Biblical one, 
hopefully you at least realize that there are other perspectives which do 
attempt to uncover the original meaning of Scripture. </p>
<p>For others, I hope this 
paper and the Scriptures I have highlighted have stretched you. Understanding 
God and His ways is no small feat. The best of us can understand so little 
about God. We can only understand what He has revealed 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/deut2929.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Deuteronomy 29:29</a>). 
Most of the time, His revelation is straightforward; in other instances, it gets 
tough.</p>
<p>Even if you embrace my 
views, there are many questions I left unanswered. Sometimes I have no answer. 
In many instances, I do have complete or partial answers, but, if I were to 
address all common questions, I would need to write a multi-volume set. 
Fortunately, there are books out there on some of these topics, and I would be 
happy to recommend them. For the most obvious set of questions (those involving 
man's limited free will/responsibility and its harmony with the doctrine of 
election), I suggest J.I. Packer's classic book, <u>Evangelism and the 
Sovereignty of God</u>.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you 
for joining me on this theological journey and giving my thoughts a fair shake.</p></ul>
