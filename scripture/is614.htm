<p><sup>1</sup> In the year that King Uzziah died, 
I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe 
filled the temple. <sup>2</sup> Above him were 
seraphs, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two 
they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
<sup>3</sup> And they were calling to one 
another: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Holy, holy, holy is the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> Almighty; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole earth is full of his glory.&quot;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>4</sup> At the sound of their voices 
the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke. </p>
