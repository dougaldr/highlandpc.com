<br>The Demise of the Pretend Evangelical Culture
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>We all know what it's like to meet a group of new people. 
We have to feel them out first to determine what is and is not safe to talk 
about.&nbsp;With some people, we have to withhold our true selves and our true 
sentiments.&nbsp;With others, we can relax and be ourselves.&nbsp;And that&#39;s the way it 
should be.&nbsp;Let me digress to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>This has been a banner year for me.&nbsp;In the fall, the 
church honored me with a gala 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary celebration.&nbsp;A few 
months later, I attended my 25<sup>th</sup> year class reunion at Moody Bible 
Institute; I&#39;ll never forget it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>From May 21-24, Luke and I had the privilege of attending 
the Moody Bible Institute&#39;s Pastor&#39;s conference (the church pays my way and I 
paid Luke&#39;s). I have attended these conferences off and on since 1980.&nbsp;But 
there was a gap in my conference attendance: I attended no conference from 1982 
until 1997.&nbsp;Since 1997, I have attended most of them.&nbsp;Not only have these 
conferences refreshed me, they have provided some much needed training through a 
variety of workshops addressing matters like preaching, counseling, conflict 
resolution, management, leadership, implementing change, stress prevention, 
missions, creative evangelism, youth ministry, time management, discipleship 
methodology&#8212;and a host of other subjects.</p>
<p>Back in 1982, the ministers were still wearing coats and 
ties to the conference, the music centered around the giant pipe organ, and 
there was an awful lot of &#34;pretending&#34; going on.&nbsp;Here were a bunch of battered 
men who needed encouragement, but they had smiles on their faces and gave the 
image of invulnerability. That&#39;s why I decided to call it quits (when it came 
to pastors&#39; conferences) in 1982.&nbsp;I had quite enough of image-oriented 
Christianity.</p>
<p>I do not think I would have ever gone back if WIWC had not 
awarded me a free ride in 1997.&nbsp;I decided to give it a fresh try, and was I 
surprised!&nbsp;Conference attendees were given a tee shirt and told to dress 
casually.&nbsp;A contemporary praise band, complete with drums and weird-looking 
guitarists, accompanied the choruses, which were projected with media 
projectors.&nbsp;The workshops and messages were honest: the longstanding tradition 
of evangelical &#34;pretending&#34; had taken a hit.&nbsp;Speakers could now freely say, &#34;I 
was worried about that&#34; instead of the pretend version, &#34;I was concerned about 
that.&#34; They admitted to frustration, aggravation, abuse by members and boards, 
burn out, and failure. They were real.</p>
<p>One of my favorites speakers of all time is Dr. Howard 
Hendricks.&nbsp;Hendricks was honest and a non-pretender even when it wasn&#39;t 
fashionable.&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the 80-year-old Dallas Seminary professor 
spoke at this year&#39;s conference and pierced our hearts.&nbsp;In one of his books, 
Hendricks recalls being hired by a church as a consultant.&nbsp;The church was 
declining and elderly.&nbsp;After evaluating the situation, Hendricks gave this 
summary: &#34;You have one of the finest church programs I have seen&#8212;for 1946!....Why 
don&#39;t you build a fence around this church and charge admission for people 
to come in and see what it was like in the previous generation?&#34; (<u>Color 
Outside the Lines</u>, p. 10)</p>
<p>Since society has changed so much and the stresses are so 
great, we can no longer expend the energy it requires to pretend.&nbsp;As a result, 
more and more pastors are adopting a new policy of honesty, telling it like it 
is, not like it should be in a world that no longer exists. Alistair Begg, 
definitely one of my top ten speakers, put it this way with his beautiful and 
witty Scottish brogue: &#34;I know what it does to you when that next person comes 
along and says, &#39;Pastor, we&#39;re leaving because we&#39;re not being fed.&#39;&nbsp;And you&#39;d 
like to say, &#39;Well open your mouth, I&#39;ve got a bunch of Scriptures I&#39;d love to 
cram down your throat!&#39;&#34;&nbsp; </p>
<p>You would have never heard that in 1982.&nbsp;In 1982, all of 
us (clergy) would have thought a similar (but not as witty) thought; we just 
would have denied the blow to our self-esteem (because we were impregnable with 
the Lord) and played the pretend game (taking our frustration out on our wife 
and kids, no doubt).&nbsp;That key element in the old formula for holy living, 
&#34;pretend,&#34; has done more harm than we can imagine.&nbsp;The emotions have to come 
out somewhere.</p>
<p>It was interesting to note my son&#39;s perspective regarding 
what he heard at the conference: &#34;Wow.&nbsp;I can see that it is really, really 
tough to be a pastor. I never realized how hard it was.&#34;&nbsp;Although he was 
surprised as to how beaten down we clergymen can become, he could also see how 
much we enjoyed the ministry despite the blows.&nbsp;It is truly a privilege to be a 
pastor.</p>
<p>The conference was a positive time.&nbsp;The speakers 
empathized with the 1200 pastors in attendance, the workshops taught us new 
skills, and we were encouraged to love our flock even if and when the sheep 
bite.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But what I am illustrating through this article is the 
positive change within the greater evangelical world: a movement toward honesty 
and away from mutually agreed upon pretending.&nbsp;We cannot hang onto 1946 because 
it is 2004.&nbsp;We do not need to pretend that we have all the answers or that we 
feel completely satisfied with lives or that our marriages are all that we 
expected them to be.&nbsp;We do not always trust God as we should, and we can even 
be honest enough to point to specific instances.&nbsp;That&#39;s real honesty!</p>
<p>When the pastors model honesty, vulnerability, and the true 
nature of being both a Christian AND a human, it spreads to the people.&nbsp;Although 
we can grieve over many of our current trends, we have an important 
victory to celebrate: the demise of the &#34;pretend&#34; evangelical culture.</p>
