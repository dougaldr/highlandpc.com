<p><sup>20</sup> When they heard this, they praised God. Then 
they said to Paul: &quot;You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, 
and all of them are zealous for the law. <sup>21</sup> They 
have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to 
turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live 
according to our customs. <sup>22</sup> What shall we do? They 
will certainly hear that you have come, <sup>23</sup> so do 
what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.
<sup>24</sup> Take these men, join in their purification rites 
and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody 
will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself 
are living in obedience to the law. <sup>25</sup> As for the 
Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain 
from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals 
and from sexual immorality.&quot; </p>
<p><sup>26</sup> The next day Paul took the men and purified 
himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date 
when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each 
of them.</p>
