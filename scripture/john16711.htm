<p><sup>7</sup>  But I tell you the truth: It is for your good that I am
going away.&nbsp; Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I
will send him to you.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> When he comes, he will convict the world of
guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment: <sup>9</sup> in regard to
sin, because men do not believe in me; <sup>10</sup> in regard to righteousness,
because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer; <sup>11</sup>
and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands
condemned.</p>
