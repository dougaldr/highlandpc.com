<p>Helper of the helpless,</p>
<p>Thank You, Jesus Christ, that You are God. You are the 
Son, the Word and the exact representation of the Father. You are also a 
sinless man. You are the God-man, the Savior of the World. Your divinity had 
no beginning, but is eternal. As God the Son, You have always existed. Your 
humanity had a beginning within the virgin's womb. But even Your humanity is 
special, for Your human nature is the firstborn of all creation—it has the 
preeminence. And from the time Your human nature was conceived, Your two 
natures are united in one Person. We cannot understand the mystery of it all; 
we can merely define the boundaries Your Word gives us!</p>
<p>But Lord Jesus, You experienced all this for a reason, to 
be our Redeemer and Savior—as part of a plan to glorify the Father, Son and 
Spirit. You were the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world. All was 
created around Your sacrifice and resurrection to Your glory.</p>
<p>Lord, use my mouth to bless others. Help me remember that, 
&quot;Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones&quot; 
(<b>Proverbs 16:24</b>). Help me remember that it is easier to damage others with my 
words than it is to build them up!</p>
<p>Lord, sometimes I have not because I ask not, so I am 
asking. Please meet the following needs, requests and desires as You see fit: __________.</p>
<p>Help me with my thought life today. Help me think positive 
and pleasant thoughts today, thoughts that please You.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray that You would strengthen the marriages in my 
family, among my friends and within my church family. Put a hedge of 
protection around them and help these folks to be determined to make their 
marriage work. Send help to them and may they avail themselves of books, 
seminars and counseling. Help them build their marriages upon You.</p>
<p>I remember the nation of Japan in my prayers. O Father, 
this nation seems to be so resistant to the Gospel. Cults like Moonies and 
Mormons are growing faster than the evangelical church!&nbsp; Only four-tenths of 
one percent of the population claim to be born-again evangelicals, despite 
religious freedom. Only 10% of the population believes in a Personal God. The 
church has not really grown since 1960, but has barely held its own. O Father, 
break through with the power of Your Spirit, I pray!</p>
<p>Thank you for the ministry of Gideons International whose 
&quot;sole purpose is to win men, women, boys and girls to a saving knowledge of 
the Lord Jesus Christ.... Members of The Gideons International place and distribute 
scriptures in 181 countries in 82 languages.... Annually, The Gideons 
International is placing and distributing more than 63,000,000 Scriptures 
worldwide.&quot; Indeed, hotels, prison, military, universities, domestic violence 
shelters, fire departments...are places stocked with Gideon Bibles. Lord, provide 
for this ministry, give harmony to the members and empower their work by Your 
Spirit!</p>
<p>Now help me reflect Your character to others today, I ask 
in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
