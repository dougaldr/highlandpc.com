<p><sup>2</sup> &quot;Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first 
offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or 
animal.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Then Moses said to the people, &quot;Commemorate 
this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the 
L<span>ORD</span> brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.
<sup>4</sup> Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
<sup>5</sup> When the L<span>ORD</span> brings you into the land of the 
Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites—the land he swore to your 
forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey—you are to observe 
this ceremony in this month: <sup>6</sup> For seven days eat 
bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the L<span>ORD</span> .
<sup>7</sup> Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; 
nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen 
anywhere within your borders. <sup>8</sup> On that day tell 
your son, 'I do this because of what the L<span>ORD</span> did for me when I came out of 
Egypt.' <sup>9</sup> This observance will be for you like a 
sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the L<span>ORD</span> is to 
be on your lips. For the L<span>ORD</span> brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
<sup>10</sup> You must keep this ordinance at the appointed 
time year after year. </p>
<p><sup>11</sup> &quot;After the L<span>ORD</span> brings you into the land 
of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your 
forefathers, <sup>12</sup> you are to give over to the L<span>ORD</span> the 
first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong 
to the L<span>ORD</span> . <sup>13</sup> Redeem with a lamb every firstborn 
donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn 
among your sons. </p>
<p><sup>14</sup> &quot;In days to come, when your son asks you, 
'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand the L<span>ORD</span> brought us out 
of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. <sup>15</sup> When 
Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the L<span>ORD</span> killed every firstborn in 
Egypt, both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the L<span>ORD</span> the first male 
offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'
<sup>16</sup> And it will be like a sign on your hand and a 
symbol on your forehead that the L<span>ORD</span> brought us out of Egypt with his mighty 
hand.&quot; </p>
