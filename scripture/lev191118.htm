<p><sup>11</sup> Do not steal. <br>Do not lie. <br>Do not deceive one another. </p>
<p><sup>12</sup> Do not swear falsely by my name and so profane the name of your God. I am the 
L<span class=sm>ORD</span>. </p>
<p><sup>13</sup> Do not defraud your neighbor or 
rob him. <br>Do not hold back the wages of a hired man overnight. </p>
<p><sup>14</sup> Do not curse the deaf or put a 
stumbling block in front of the blind, but fear your God. I am the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>. </p>
<p><sup>15</sup> Do not pervert justice; do not 
show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor 
fairly. </p>

<p><sup>16</sup> Do not go about spreading slander among your people.<br>
Do not do anything that endangers your neighbor's life. I am the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>

<p><sup>17</sup> Do not hate your brother in your heart. Rebuke your neighbor frankly so
you will not share in his guilt.</p>

<p><sup>18</sup> Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against one of your people, but love
your neighbor as yourself. I am the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>
