<p><sup>1</sup> Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the
wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.&nbsp; <sup>2</sup>
But his delight is in the law of the L<span>ORD</span>, and on his law he meditates day and
night.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> He is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields
its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither.&nbsp; Whatever he does prospers.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Not so the wicked!&nbsp; They are like chaff that the wind blows away.&nbsp;
<sup>5</sup> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinner in
the assembly of the righteous.</p>

<p><sup>6</sup> For the L<span>ORD</span> watches over the way of the righteous, but the way
of the wicked will perish.</p>
