<p>Lord,</p>
<p>Thank You that You are always aware and monitoring our 
needs. Thank You for Your heart of compassion; Your emotions are always part 
of Your relationship with us. You are not some austere and distant God, nor are 
You some sort of divine computer. Like us, You have intellect, emotions and 
will. Unlike us, You know ALL to the minutest detail; You see the mites that 
live on the mites and the single cell creatures and the molecules and the atoms 
and the parts of every atom and beyond. If we go the other way, You see the 
vast universe. You have the entire spectrum of feelings and while You are 
rejoicing with me, You are the sharing the grief of another. You completely 
amaze me!</p>
<p>I pray for my pastor, staff and church board leaders, 
officers and teachers. If any do not know You, may they become born-again. 
Help them to be true to the Bible and to put Your Word over their own personal 
agendas. Help them to have genuine integrity, Biblical convictions, love, 
wisdom and courage. Help them put their walk with You first, their families 
second and their ministries third. Do not allow others to intimidate them into 
neglecting their families and remind them that &quot;the fear of man works a 
snare.&quot; Help them be most concerned about pleasing You while also seeking 
peace and harmony within the congregation.</p>
<p>Father, I have some personal health concerns including: __________. I also pray 
for the physical, mental, or spiritual health of others including: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the nation of Spain. With its history of 
Inquisition and intolerance, the evangelical church has been small in Spain. 
Thank You that this is changing. Although only .4% of the population claims to 
be born-again evangelicals, this represents a significant growth from the mere 
3,000 believers in 1900 to nearly 100,000 today. Thank You for the growth! 
Lord, help the evangelical church in Spain to triple over the next decade! Help 
the evangelical church in Spain and other Christians from outside to thoroughly 
evangelize this nation. May Your Spirit grant many the repentance that leads to 
life.</p>
<p>Today I pray for the ministry of China Partner, Inc., &quot;established to
serve the Church in China as it fulfills the Great Commission.... CP 
is unique in that it works with the registered churches and seminaries in 
China.... CP exists to help build up and equip the Church in China. This is 
accomplished by working in four main areas of ministry<b>: </b>pastoral training...Christian 
literature distribution 
program...China conferences...[and] Bible school and church construction.&quot; Father, 
provide for this ministry and although the registered churches are restricted 
by the government, help those who know You and participate in these churches to 
grow in their faith and share Christ effectively, I ask.</p>
<p>I remember those who work as water and liquid waste 
treatment plant and system operators. Bless them with safety, help them to do 
their work with integrity and may those who know You share their faith and walk 
the walk.</p>
<p>Help me to walk the walk today, in the Messiah's Name, 
Amen.</p>
