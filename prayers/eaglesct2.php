<br>Benediction for An Eagle Scout Ceremony
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Our God, we have heard a lot today about character, 
persistence, courage, loyalty, cheerfulness, service, setting an example, 
protecting the weak and the helpless. Lord, we admire these qualities, and we 
pray that they would serve __________ well over his lifetime.</p>
<p>We know, Lord, that being an Eagle Scout is a lifelong 
responsibility, and we pray not only that __________ would exemplify 
these qualities, but we ask that he might influence others to do the same.</p>
<p>Now dismiss us with your blessing, we pray, </p>
<p>In Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
