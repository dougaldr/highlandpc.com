<p><sup>24</sup>&nbsp; And are justified freely by his grace through the
redemption that came by Christ Jesus.&nbsp; <sup>25</sup> God presented him as a
sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate
his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed
beforehand unpunished&#151; <sup>26</sup> he did it to demonstrate his justice at
the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have
faith in Jesus.</p>

<p><sup>27</sup> Where, then, is boasting?&nbsp; It is excluded.&nbsp; On what principle? On
that of observing the law?&nbsp; No, but on that of faith.&nbsp; <sup>28</sup> For we
maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.&nbsp; <sup>29</sup>
Is God the God of Jews only?&nbsp; Is he not the God of Gentiles too?&nbsp; Yes, of Gentiles
too, <sup>30</sup> since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised
by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.&nbsp; <sup>31</sup> Do we,
then, nullify the law by this faith?&nbsp; Not at all!&nbsp; Rather we uphold the law. </p>
