<br>Meet Jethro
<br>(Exodus 2:15b-25)

<div>
<p>It can be irritating when someone who is not &quot;in the 
know&quot; interferes just because he has a title.</p>
<p>I have done this more than once over the years, and I 
try to guard myself. I like to interfere. It is my anti-spiritual gift.</p>
<p>One man learned his lesson:</p>
<p>A business owner decides to take a tour around his business 
and see how things are going. He goes down to the shipping docks and sees a 
young man leaning against the wall doing nothing. The owner walks up to the 
young man and says, &quot;Son, how much do you make a day?&quot;</p>
<p>The guy replies, &quot;150 dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>The owner pulls out his wallet, gives him $150, and tells 
him to get out and never come back.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the shipping clerk asks the owner, 
&quot;Have you seen the UPS driver? I asked him to wait here for me!&quot;</p>
<p>Moses felt like an interferer. who had failed and bitten 
off more than he could chew. He had apparently tried to begin a movement to 
free to the Hebrews 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/acts725.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Acts 7:25</a>), 
but they did not respond to him. After killing 
an Egyptian, he had to flee Egypt for his life.</p>

	<li>
	<p>Where did Moses go?</p>
	<ol type=1>
		<li>
		<p>Ancient Midian (probably about 250 miles 
journey).</p>
		<li>
		<p>Modern Saudi Arabia.</p>
		<p>
		<img border="0" src="../../images/dezdisp/mapmidsa.jpg" width="250" height="314"></p>
		<p>This will become a big issue later on when we talk about 
the Real Mt. Sinai and its location in Saudi Arabia.&nbsp; Egyptian territory went as 
far as the Red Sea.</p>
	</ol>
<li><p>Moses intervenes 
in another case of injustice.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Moses was intimidating to 
	these other shepherds in his Egyptian garb.</p>
	<li><p>He must have been pretty 
	tough looking to scare the other guys away.</p>
	<li><p>The Middle Easterners were 
	big on hospitality and treating strangers well.</p>
	<li><p>It would not be an uncommon 
	thing for these gals to invite Moses home to meet the family and stay 
	overnight.</p>
</ol>
<li><p>Moses meets Jethro, aka
Reuel.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Called a priest (as 
well as a shepherd).</p>
<li><p>An organizational 
genius who would help the nation of Israel get organized.</p></ol>
<li><p>Who was Jethro? Who were the
Midianites?</p>
<ol type=1><li><p><b>Genesis 25:1-2</b> reads, &quot;Abraham 
took another wife, whose name was Keturah. She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.&quot; </p>
<li><p>Midianites: In the Bible, the Midianites are described as worshipping a multitude of gods, including Baal-peor 
and the Asherah. </p>
<p>The Midianites 
also seem to have been centered around a cultic site at Mount Horeb. This has 
led some scholars to speculate that the worship of YHWH (the name of God in 
Judaism) may have actually begun among the Midianites, to be adapted later by 
the Israelites. An Egyptian inscription refers to &quot;Yhw in the land of the Shasu&quot; 
as a tribe or people living in what would later become Midianite territory. 
According to the Bible the Midianites, like the Israelites, practiced 
circumcision. (source: Wikipedia)</p>
<li><p>This belief in 
Yahweh and circumcision were handed down from Abraham. But 
the Midianites had added other gods to their religious beliefs and were probably 
a Henotheistic people (as opposed to monotheistic).</p>
<li><p>We see this after the Exodus, 
when Jethro declares:</p>
<p><b>Exodus 18:9-12</b>, 
&quot;Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> had done for 
Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians. He said, 'Praise be to 
the L<span class=sm>ORD</span>, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who 
rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the L<span class=sm>ORD</span> is 
greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel 
arrogantly.'&quot; </p>
<li><p>The religion 
of the Midianites was a precursor to Zoroastrianism, a monotheistic religion 
similar to Judaism, that swept much of Persia and parts of India -- and still 
exists today. They produced a group of men called Magi, and the founder of the 
Magi was said to be the prophet Balaam whom we will encounter later.</p>
<li><p>Jethro is an example for us:</p>
<ol type=a><li><p>He was hospitable and warm.</p>
<li><p>He did not reject someone just because he was different.</p>
<li><p>Many lonely people have no friends for four major reasons: 
<ol type=i><li><p>They do 
not want to be friends with someone unlike them...instead of finding a few points 
of convergence, they want a lot of convergence. I have friends who share a common faith; I have friends who are 
part of our dance club; I have friends who hold different political views from 
me (although people are getting so rude and rampage-like about politics these 
days, it can become difficult); friends who are older, friends who are younger….</p>
<li><p>The second reason is that they lack boldness; they wait for others to 
come up to them and stand in corners with their arms crossed....</p>
<li><p>Third, they overdo it and drive friends away…. Moses and Jethro's 
friendship was mutually beneficial....</p>
<li><p>Fourth, when an issue comes up, they do not assert themselves 
gently.</p></ol></ol></ol>

<li><p><b>Moses Settles in Midian 
(</b><a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ex215b20.htm')" target=_self class=pop>21-22</a><b>).</b></p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Hired to work.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Jethro may have had no sons.</p>
	<li><p>He took a liking to Moses.</p>
	<li><p>They were related 400 years back.</p>
	<li><p>Spoke similar languages .</li>
</ol>
<li><p>Brought into the family.</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Moses settles down 
in Midian.</p>
<li><p>He had a lot 
to process.... He had failed to deliver his fellow Hebrews, a broken man living in 
exile.</p>
<ol type=a><li><p>Do you allow yourself time to process loss, grief, &amp; 
disappointment?</p>
<li><p>Do you allow others that time, or try to cut it short in the name 
of faith?</p></ol>
<li><p>Life must have 
seemed sedate; but that is what Moses needed.</p>
<ol type=a><li><p>No longer the man of &quot;action&quot;.</p>
<li><p>No longer &quot;mighty in word&quot;.</p>
<li><p>No longer royalty.</p>

<li><p>God does not change his timing.</p>
<p>He announced His plan beforehand in <b>Genesis 15:13-14</b>: &quot;God 
said to Abram, 'Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a 
land that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred 
years. But I will also judge the nation whom they will serve, and afterward they 
will come out with many possessions.'&quot;</p>

<p>He hears, remembers, looks upon and knows your heartaches 
and miseries…and, in time, He will address them all…</p>
<p><b>Revelation 6:9-11</b>, &quot;When he opened the fifth seal, I saw 
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God 
and the testimony they had maintained. They called out in a loud voice, 'How 
long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the 
earth and avenge our blood?' Then each of them was given a white robe, and they 
were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and 
brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Thomas Andrew Dorsey was a black jazz musician from 
Atlanta. In the twenties he gained a certain amount of notoriety as the composer 
of jazz tunes with suggestive lyrics, but he gave all that up in 1926 to 
concentrate exclusively on spiritual music. &quot;Peace in the Valley&quot; is one of his 
best known songs, but there is a story behind his most famous song that deserves 
to be told. In 1932 the times were hard for Dorsey. Just trying to survive the 
depression years as a working musician meant tough sledding. On top of that, his 
music was not accepted by many people. Some said it was much too worldly - the 
devil's music, they called it. Many years later Dorsey could laugh about it. He 
said, &quot;I got kicked out of some of the best churches in the land.&quot; But the real 
kick in the teeth came one night in St. Louis when he received a telegram 
informing him that his pregnant wife had died suddenly. Dorsey was so filled 
with grief that his faith was shaken to the roots, but instead of wallowing in 
self-pity, he turned to the discipline he knew best - music. In the midst of 
agony he wrote the following lyrics: Precious Lord, take my hand, Lead me on, 
let me stand. I am tired, I am weak, I am worn. Through the storm, through the 
night, Lead me on to the light; Take my hand precious Lord, lead me home. 
(Pulpit Helps)</p>
<p>God's ways are indeed mysterious; but His character and 
nature - into which we are anchored securely - are completely dependable. In 
the end, all things work together for good - to them that love God.</p>
<p>God's plan goes forward - in His time and in His way.</p>
