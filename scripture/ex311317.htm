<p><sup>13</sup> Say to the Israelites, "You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign 
between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the 
L<span>ORD</span>, who makes you holy."</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> "Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy 
to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on 
that day must be cut off from his people. <sup>15</sup> For six 
days, work is to be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the 
L<span>ORD</span>. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.
<sup>16</sup> The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, 
celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
<sup>17</sup> It will be a sign between me and the Israelites 
forever, for in six days the L<span>ORD</span> made the heavens and the earth, and on the 
seventh day he abstained from work and rested."</p>
