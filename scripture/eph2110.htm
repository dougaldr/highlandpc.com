<p><sup>1</sup> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, <sup>2</sup>
in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are
disobedient.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> All of us also lived among them at one time gratifying
the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts.&nbsp; Like
the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> But because of his
great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, <sup>5</sup> made us alive with
Christ even when we were dead in transgressions&#151;it is by grace you have been
saved.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in
the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, <sup>7</sup> in order that in the coming
ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his
kindness to us in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> For it is by grace you have been
saved, through faith&#151;and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&#151; <sup>9</sup>
not by works, so that no one can boast.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> For we are God's
workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in
advance for us to do.</p>
