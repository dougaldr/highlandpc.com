<br>God Almighty, You are Lord of all. You are Yahweh, the Great I AM.&nbsp;
You
are also Abba, our Heavenly Father. Thank You for caring about us.</p>
<p>Lord, as we end another day, we admit we fell short of your perfection.&nbsp;
Sometimes we sin and are not even aware of it, other times we know and see our
sin. Then we inadvertently hurt others or act less than wisely.</p>
<p>We thank You for the forgiveness we have in Christ. We acknowledge our sins
and imperfections, and claim the cleansing that comes through the blood of
Christ.</p>
<p>Father, we pray that You would keep us from every kind of harm and evil every
moment of our lives. Send angels to watch and protect us.</p>
<p>We pray for our lost families and friends, that they would come to know
Jesus. Help us to look for opportunities You provide for us to tell them about
You.</p>
<p>We pray for our missionaries. We think of the Aldridge family. We pray that
You will keep them walking with You, and we pray that You would make Your will
clear to them. Protect them and provide for them.</p>
<p>We pray that our family here would follow You, that each of us would grow
strong in our Lord Jesus Christ and His Word. Help us to stand firm for what we
believe, and help us to obey the Word, not just understand it. Help us each to
be constantly filled with Your Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Help us to work out our many problems. Bless Highland Park Church, and guide
the pastor and all the leaders of the church. Help our attitudes to be pleasing
to You. We ask You for a good, restful, night's sleep. Keep us from sin and help
us experience your joy tomorrow.</p>
<p>We pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
<p><b><a name="p2"></a>#2&nbsp;
<br>You Who never sleep or slumber, thank You that because You never are off
guard, we can be. We can sleep in peace because You are with us during the night
watches.</b></p>
<p><b>Sometimes our faith is weak and we are afraid, dear Lord. Help us to be bold
in You, for You have not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and a
sound mind.</b></p>
<p><b>Sometimes we are selfish, Lord, and want our own way. Thank You that You gave
us an example of unselfishness by sending Jesus. Jesus emptied Himself of the
use of His powers as God and submitted Himself to You, Father. Thank You that He
took our sins upon Himself, and died to pay our penalty so that we could be
forgiven. Thank You that He didn't stay dead, but came back to life on the third
day. He did all that for us. We can at least consider others and not be so
selfish.</b></p>
<p><b>Thank You for our missionaries. Today, we remember Matt and Janet Dawson.&nbsp;
As
they minister in the Ivory Coast, we pray that
you would provide for their spiritual and physical needs. May they sense Your
blessing upon them.</b></p>
<p><b>We pray that our family would be healthy and safe. We thank You that we are
strong in Jesus and that we can serve You because You help us.</b></p>
<p><b>We ask You to touch those among our family and friends who have health needs
now <i>(you may list them</i>). We ask You to touch the souls of our
family and friends, particularly those we think may not know You (<i>you may mention names here</i>).</b></p>
<p><b>Help us have good attitudes tomorrow, and help us keep our minds on good
things. Help us make choices that please You. Help us respect authority and to
be patient when we have to wait. Help us not to complain, and give us a spirit
of thankfulness. Bless our church and its leaders. Guide our president,
congress, judges, and governors.</b></p>
<p><b>We pray in the Name of the Savior, Amen.</b></p>
<p><a name="p3"></a>#3&nbsp;
<br>O Sovereign God of all creation, we thank You that Your Son, our Savior, the
Lord Jesus Christ, said, &quot;Allow the little children to come to Me.&quot;&nbsp;
He
showed us that You love all people, young or old, black, white, red, and yellow,
men and women, rich and poor.</p>
<p>Though You love all, we thank You for the special attention You give us
because we know Jesus. Thank You that we have eternal life, and that no one can
snatch us out of Your hand. It's not because we behave well that our sins are
forgiven and heaven is our home, but because Jesus paid the penalty for our sins
so we could be forgiven. Thank You for Jesus, dear Father.</p>
<p>Lord, we want to grow in You. Help us to want to read our Bibles, to want to
pray, to want to go to church, and to want to obey. Sometimes You give us so
many blessings, whether it be toys for young children or hobbies or sports or
fun things, that we forget the One who blessed us. Give us a desire to know You
better.</p>
<p>Almighty God, we are concerned about lost friends and family members (<i>you
may list them here</i>). We also pray for those who risk their lives for others,
such as policemen, firemen, and those who serve in the military. Protect them,
we pray.</p>
<p>We remember those who spend their lives reaching others for Jesus. We pray
for the missionaries our church sent out over 40 years ago, Bruce and Joyce
Moore. We pray that You would continue to bless them with health and wisdom.&nbsp;
Continue to use them, we pray.</p>
<p>We also pray for Child Evangelism Fellowship, Larry and Bonnie Habegger, as
they tell others about Jesus. And we pray for Sam Stevens and his tabernacle
ministry. Guide our church leaders, we pray the elders, deacons, deaconesses,
teachers and leaders.</p>
<p>We ask your continued protection. Please keep us from every kind of harm and
evil. Help us to work out all our problems and fill us with wisdom. Help each of
us to be kind and considerate and to try to understand how others feel. Help us
not to be concerned just about ourselves.</p>
<p>Help our family to get along well. Keep us from strife, and when we can't
agree, help us to be kind and honest. May others see we are different because we
know Jesus.</p>
<p>We pray in His Name, Amen.</p>
<p><b><a name="p4"></a>#4&nbsp;
<br>El Shaddai, the God Who really sees, we come to You as a few among many of
Your servants. And we do want to serve You. Thank You, Father, that, in Your
love, You serve us as well. You sent Your Son in the Person of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
He
said He came to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</b></p>
<p><b>Father, we human beings do not know for sure what tomorrow will bring.&nbsp;
But we
can rest assured that You know the future. Yesterday and tomorrow, a day or a
thousand years, are all alike to You. So we rest assured that You, the God Who
cares about us, is in control.</b></p>
<p><b>May our sleep be refreshing and our dreams pleasant. We ask Your constant
protection for us. Help keep us from sinning. Help us to do Your will, even when
we do not feel like it.</b></p>
<p><b>We ask that You would continue to provide us with our daily needs. When we
wrong others, help us be brave enough to ask their forgiveness. When we sin,
help us not make excuses.</b></p>
<p><b>Every family has its problems and challenges, and we are no exception.&nbsp;
Help
us to work out our problems in our family, at work, in the neighborhood, at
school, at church, and even within ourselves. Give us wisdom, we pray.</b></p>
<p><b>We ask your blessing upon our Christian radio stations, the Rescue Mission,
and every church that is true to the Bible. Open the eyes of those who have
never understood the Gospel.</b></p>
<p><b>We know that You control the nations. We ask that our world may experience
peace and prosperity in the near future. And we ask that there might be more
open doors for the Gospel, particularly in Asia and North Africa.</b></p>
<p><b>Help us to obey Your Word. Help us to obey those in authority over us.</b></p>
<p><b>Help us to obey the Two Great Commandments, to love You, God with all our
being, and our neighbor as our self.</b></p>
<p><b>We ask this in Jesus' Name, Amen.</b></p>
<p><a name="p5"></a>#5&nbsp;
<br>Great God of Wonders, how You bless us! We thank You for our senses, that we
can see, feel, taste, hear, and smell. Thank You for the many beautiful things
we come across. When we are happy, help us remember to thank You. When are
hearts are heavy, help us find strength from You.</p>
<p>Father, we know many people do not want to follow You. It is difficult for us
to follow You, but when we deal with others who do not love You, it is even
harder. Help us to do right, to follow You, and never to be ashamed of You.</p>
<p>Guide those who make and enforce the laws in our land. Help these laws to be
ones that you are pleased with. Help those who are lonely and have no family.&nbsp;
Help each of us to be encouraging people, ready to pray for others and express
concern.</p>
<p>Help our attitudes to be pure. When we have chores we don't want to do,
lessons we find boring, and new tasks that make us feel uncertain, help us to
remember You. Help us always to do Your will and help us not to be swayed by our
feelings. Tune our hearts in with Yours.</p>
<p>Bind the evil one, keep us from his snares. Help our family to speak
truthfully and kindly with one another. Help us check ourselves when we feel
impatient. Help us to share and to look out for the others in our family.&nbsp;
Keep
us from competing with one another. Help us not to worry about who is best in
this or that, but to rejoice when anyone in our family does something well.</p>
<p>We ask that those in our neighborhood would all come to know and obey Jesus.&nbsp;
Help us not just to know Him, but also to obey Him.</p>
<p>Bless our church, our pastor and his family, and all the missionaries of
Highland Park Church. We ask you to comfort, strengthen, and provide for the
Doug Anderson family.</p>
<p>May Your Holy Spirit control our church, our families, and all believers in
our area. Bless those who work in Sunday School, Children's Church, the
Children's Choir, Awana, and the nursery.</p>
<p>Help us all learn to say, &quot;I'm sorry, please forgive me.&quot; Give us a
hunger for Your truth. We praise You, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In Jesus'
Name, Amen.</p>
<p><b><a name="p6"></a>#6&nbsp;
<br>O Holy King Who sits enthroned above the angels, You are He Who knows all,
sees all, is present everywhere, has all power, yet You care about each sparrow
that falls. How much You care for us! You loved us so much, You sent Your Son to
be our Savior. Since You gave us Your only Son, we know that You will provide
for us as You see fit.</b></p>
<p><b>Lord, we don't fully understand You. We know You have feelings, You think,
and You make decisions. But Your ways are higher than ours, and our minds are
but feeble compared to Yours. So we trust You, even when we don't understand
Your ways.</b></p>
<p><b>Thank you for people who love us. Although our families are not perfect, we
are so grateful that we are not alone in this world. Thank You for friends, for
living in a free country, and for our church where we can learn more about Your
will through Your Word.</b></p>
<p><b>We ask You, Lord of hosts, who control all the host of heaven, to send angels
to watch and protect us. We pray that You would create in us a clean heart and
wash away the sin in our lives.</b></p>
<p><b>Father, sometimes life is boring and routine. Though we may not appreciate
the routine of life, we are grateful that it reminds us that You are dependable,
consistent, and the same. You are faithful. So, we too, must be faithful in the
routine of life. We don't need to have something new or exciting every moment.</b></p>
<p><b>And Lord, You are the truth. Help us to be truthful people. Help us not to
lie, cheat, or trick people. Help us to be honest with ourselves as well.&nbsp;
Teach
us when to say nothing and when to speak up.</b></p>
<p><b>Yahweh, there are many who have never understood Your Gospel. Some know a
little about Jesus, but they do not understand how we are freely forgiven by
trusting Him. Instead, they are trying to save themselves. But You, Lord, are
the Savior; we cannot save ourselves. Bless Abigail Blanch and all the folks
with the Spanish World Gospel Mission, as they try to reach people like this.&nbsp;
Provide for Abigail's health needs, her financial needs, and her spiritual
needs. Help her walk with You and lead her into Your perfect will.</b></p>
<p><b>Help our family to get along well. Sometimes we have our difficult days.&nbsp;
Help
us ask forgiveness when we sin against each other. Help us be considerate of
each other. Help us realize we are on the same team; we are not out to compete
with each other, but to support one another.</b></p>
<p><b>We offer this prayer in Jesus Name, Amen.</b></p>
<p><a name="p7"></a>#7&nbsp;
<br>Our gracious God, as we end another day, we thank You that You will never
leave us or forsake us. You have had Your hand upon us today, You will continue
to have Your hand upon us tonight and tomorrow. How we appreciate Your watching
of us.</p>
<p>We pray for restful sleep. We ask that we would rise tomorrow and remember
You. We ask that You would remind us of Your presence during the day, and that
You would lead us to an opportunity to share the good news of Jesus with someone
tomorrow.</p>
<p>We know Your Word tells us that sometimes we can pray and not get what we ask
for because we are praying outside Your will. Sometimes our own sin blocks our
prayers. Thank You that we can admit our sins to You and ask You to forgive us
and You will do so. You have promised to do so.</p>
<p>But often, we have not because we ask not. There are certain things, Lord,
You will provide for us only if we ask. If we do not ask, they will not come to
be. So we ask You to reach down and draw our lost family members to you (<i>you
may list them here, if you wish</i>). We also ask You to provide us with wisdom
in any difficult decisions we need to make.</p>
<p>Help the parents in this family to direct this family Your way. Help the
children to obey and make it easier for the parents to lead this family. Show
each of us when we are doing something in a way that doesn't please You. Remind
us of verses we have memorized or read when we need them. Keep us from error in
what we believe or do.</p>
<p>May others see the joy of Jesus in us. Help us learn to be content in Him,
and not search for happiness in ways that would displease our Savior. Constantly
fill us with Your Holy Spirit, that we would be motivated to serve You, love
You, and do Your will.</p>
<p>Help keep us from being brainwashed by the world. What we see on TV, hear on
the radio, or the things friends do may not be what You want, Lord. Help us to
be on the alert. Help us to think and not just go along with what everybody else
is doing.</p>
<p>Help us to be patient and careful. Help us consider the feelings of other
family members and friends. Guide our government leaders and the leaders of the
nations of the world. We especially pray for believers in other parts of the
world who are being persecuted. We pray that all nations would guarantee true
freedom of religion, and that those who know Jesus would have peace and safety.</p>
<p>Thank You for being so very good to us. We pray in Jesus Name, Amen.</p>
