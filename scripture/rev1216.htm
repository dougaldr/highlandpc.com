<p><sup>1</sup> A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman 
clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of 
twelve stars on her head. <sup>2</sup> She was pregnant and cried 
out in pain as she was about to give birth. <sup>3</sup> Then another 
sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and 
ten horns and seven crowns on his heads. <sup>4</sup> His tail swept 
a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The 
dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so 
that he might devour her child the moment it was born. <sup>5</sup> 
She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations 
with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his 
throne. <sup>6</sup> The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared 
for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.</p>
