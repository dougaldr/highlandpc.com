<br>April 2

<p>My gracious Master and my God,</p>
<p>You are a benevolent God. You are kind, generous and 
compassionate. Our Lord Jesus Christ is a high priest Who can sympathize with 
our weaknesses. Although You are a consuming fire, You are also tenderhearted, 
charitable and good. Even though we have sinned against You, You still love us 
and care about us and feel for us and provide for us.</p>
<p>Thank You, Lord, that for me—and all Who know Christ—death has lost its sting. 
At death, my body and soul are separated. Although 
my soul will go to enjoy your presence, one day my resurrection body and soul 
will be reunited. But I will never face spiritual death, the separation of my 
soul from You. This is the second death, experienced by those who do not know 
Christ. Jesus will say to them, &quot;Depart from me.... I never knew you.&quot; Thank You 
that Jesus knows me!</p>
<p>Great Father of Lights, I pray that You would enlighten 
those who are struggling with substance abuse and addictions. Some who name the 
Name of Christ find themselves captive to alcohol, prescription drugs, illegal 
drugs, pornography, or are rampant spenders of money. Give them grace and the 
courage to believe that life can be rich and meaningful without their 
addiction. Help them develop new habits and associations to replace the old 
ones and help them to focus on getting to know You more than anything else.</p>
<p>Lord, I thank You for the many Christians who live in 
Finland. Over 12.5% of the population claim to be evangelicals. Thank You that 
the state Lutheran church in Finland tends to be evangelical and that these 
folks have ministered to reach out into Estonia and parts of Russia that are 
linguistically and culturally related. But, Lord, the church is ageing; help 
the efforts to bring in young people, may they settle and set roots in one solid 
congregation rather than church hop, and help the churches to develop new 
paradigms to better minister in the current age. We pray that the number of 
born-again evangelicals would approach 20% within the next decade. Also thwart 
the growth of cults and non-Christian religions, I pray.</p>
<p>Thank You for the work of Evangelism Explosion as they seek 
to train lay workers in churches throughout the world regarding how to share the 
Gospel. We know that thousands upon thousands have been led to Christ through 
EE, and we pray that the best days are yet ahead. Empower the organization by 
Your Spirit, prosper their efforts and use them to get the good news of Jesus 
Christ out to a lost society.</p>
<p>I remember pharmacists in prayer. Lord, help them to be 
careful and to do a good job in organizing and explaining medications to those 
in need. May those who know Christ tactfully share their faith with fellow 
pharmacists and with others.</p>
<p>Today, Lord, help me to live for You, I pray in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
