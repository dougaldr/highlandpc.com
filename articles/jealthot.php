<br>Informal Thoughts on Jealousy
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>I have always thought of jealous adults as childish. But as I thought
more and more about matters, I came to realize that many of the sins we see so
clearly in childhood carry over into adulthood. We simply learn to hide
them better. For many of us, the weaknesses and sins we displayed in
childhood are still with us: jealousy, laziness, a critical spirit, fits
of temper, etc.</p>

<p>The other day, I was teaching our Awana kids about how Laban was jealous of
Jacob. God blessed Laban with wealth, measured in livestock in those days.&nbsp;
Jacob, who started raising livestock with Laban's rejects, began to catch up to
and surpass Laban (<b>Genesis 30-31</b>). &nbsp;Laban and his sons became so jealous
that Jacob and his family had to escape for their lives. Had God not
warned Laban in a dream, he may well have killed Jacob.</p>

<p>Johann Strauss Sr. was a jealous father. He was a musical genius, but
he envied his son, Johann Strauss Jr., who surpassed him in genius and fame.&nbsp;
When we speak of the &quot;Strauss Waltzes,&quot; we are usually talking about
the work of Johann Jr. Time and time again we hear stories about parents
who are jealous of their children's talents, beauty, or &quot;breaks in
life.&quot; Others of us want our children to have everything so that we can
move in with them!</p>

<p>Even those of us in ministry get jealous. I hear of some pastors (who I
would not want in my family) whose churches grow leaps and bounds. Some of
these guys don't know Genesis from Revelation and are professional manipulators,
yet their churches blossom, while other faithful pastors who love the Lord see
their churches actually dissolve. Of course, jealousy over good men whose
ministries blossom is a temptation as well.</p>

<p>Like Laban, a lot of jealousy originates in a competitive spirit. If we
are doing badly, we do not mind it so much as long as everyone else does badly.&nbsp;
But if someone surpasses us, we are tempted to resent it. If someone's
marriage seems happier, their job easier, their talents greater, their physique
better, or their children more successful, that tendency seen in childhood (you
got more toys than I did for Christmas; you have a 26-inch bike and I only have
a 24; you were chosen first for the softball team, I was chosen last) can
resurface with a vengeance.</p>

<p>We do not understand God's ways: he gives one talent to some, five to
another, and to yet another ten. He tells us to rejoice with those who
rejoice, to weep with those who weep. He commands us to look out not only
for our own interests, but the interests of others. He labels jealousy
among the works of the flesh
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/gal519.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Galatians 5:19</a>)
and lists it right after hatred. I think they are listed that way because they are closely associated. Laban's
sin began with jealousy, as did Cain's. It progressed to hatred and would
have culminated in murder, as did Cain's. Most Christians do not go around
murdering others, but we do show our hatred in various ways: we slander,
we withdraw from those we hate, we stew and become bitter, we take ourselves out
of a position where the one we envy can &quot;show us up.&quot;</p>

<p>If the person we are jealous of &quot;rubs it in,&quot; that only makes it
worse. If we are ever the one of whom another is jealous, we should not
try to aggravate the situation through teasing or humiliating. But
even if we are blameless (as Jacob and Abel were in their situations), and even
if we do not encourage jealousy, others may still resent us.</p>

<p>Our church is noted for strong families, solid doctrine, and a level of sense
not all that common today. I know as a fact that some people have rejected
our fellowship for those very reasons. I know it sounds weird, but that is
the way jealousy works. We tend to think that letting the Lord order our
lives will draw others to him. But many times&#151;even if we are not arrogant
about things&#151;it actually repels people.</p>

<p>So be on your guard from both angles. Deal with jealousy as a sin,
because it is a sin, and a big one at that! And also be sensitive that
sometimes when you are blessed, that blessing can actually hurt another
emotionally (and I do not think it is sinful to feel hurt), or even provoke
hatred (a clearly sinful response). God loves all his children, but
we are tempted to think he loves some of us more than others. And he does
bless some of us more than others, no doubt about that.</p>

<p>It is hard to rejoice in another's wonderful marriage retreat when your
marriage is on the rocks. It's tough to rejoice at the birth of a new
child when you and your spouse cannot conceive. It is difficult to rejoice
at the marriage of a child who has always walked with the Lord when your child
has caused you heartache after heartache and is an absolute mess. It may
be painful to thank the Lord for healing someone when you are now a widow and
your prayers for a spouse's healing were unanswered. There is a lot of
pain out there, and we all (including myself for sure) need to work at becoming
more sensitive to how our blessings remind others of their lack.</p>

<p>It is hard to go through life's rugged road without feeling hurt or sometimes
even passed by. But we do not need to be jealous. Remember Laban. Remember Cain.&nbsp;
Put off jealousy. <b>You are not competing against
your brethren, you are competing against yourself, the world, and the devil.&nbsp;
</b>Force
your thoughts in line with the truth. Jealousy is a bummer.</p>
