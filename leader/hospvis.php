<br>Hospital Visitation: The Ins and Outs
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p align="center">
<b>A realistic & honest approach for pastors and lay leaders</b></p>
  
<ol type="I">
<b><li>Introduction and Purpose</b>
<p>In many churches, the purpose of 
hospital visitation is simply that it is expected. The custom of a pastor, lay 
leader, or other church visitor (as opposed to a visit by a friend or relative 
inside the church or without) is just something churches or pastors do.</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue can become 
silly. Some people may want to visit if they are having simple outpatient tests. 
Some people practically want you to go with them to the dentist. The demands 
and expectations of people, culture and custom can cloud the reason for 
visitation completely. This is especially true among rural churches.</p>
<p>The custom of visiting church 
members in the hospital is derived from the principle of visiting and 
encouraging the sick or helping people during times of distress. A couple of 
generations ago, people often went to the hospital for only the most serious 
situations. Babies were born at home, surgeries were done in living rooms and 
doctors made house calls. When you went to the hospital, it was a truly 
traumatic event.</p>
<p>Hospitalization went to the other 
extreme in the 1970s and early 80s. Doctors would put their elderly patients 
in the hospital for two weeks just because they had the flu! When I first came 
to Highland Park Church, I inherited some practices that I considered silly. I 
had to visit elderly women in the hospital who merely had the flu—and I was 
expected to visit them every day of the week. In those instances, the ladies 
had plenty of family attention, so it was not a matter of them being without 
support. Of course, this displaced more productive ministry. Needless to say, 
we now have a more sensible system in place. Where do these—sometimes silly, 
sometimes reasonable—rules come from? </p>
<p>Like an old European city that 
just &quot;happened,&quot; many churches and communities have accumulated a hodgepodge of 
traditions that eventually dogmatize into expectations. A more reasonable 
approach should be based upon convictions and logic.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the purposes of 
a church (or clergy) visit to the hospital. Here are a few:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To share Christ with those who do 
	not know Him (goodwill ambassador)</li>
	<li>To express Christian love to a 
	person who may be afraid, discouraged, or lonely (fellowship and love)</li>
	<li>To show friendship to a member of 
	the Body of Christ (relational development)</li>
	<li>To offer the encouragement of the 
	Scriptures and prayer (spiritual edification)</li>
	<li>To affirm that the church family 
	is there to support the person (sympathy, empathy and solidarity)</li>
	<li>To minister to the person and 
	family in times of death, fear and uncertainty (emotional, spiritual and 
	psychological support via one's presence); Paul Cedar refers to the 
	&quot;sacerdotal presence&quot; of a pastor. Although theologically questionable, to 
	many people the presence of a pastor psychologically and emotionally 
	symbolizes the presence of God's care.</li>
	<li>Rewarding people who have 
	faithfully served our church by honoring them with some attention 
	(recognition) when they feel vulnerable. Though this may sound trite, 
	relationships are built around reciprocity.</li>
</ol>
<p><u><b>When people are 
hospitalized, they feel vulnerable and need the comfort of a church shepherd; 
they need to be pointed toward the Good Shepherd.</b></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><li>Visits: From Priority to Luxury</b>
<ol type=A><li><b><u>Crucial visits</u></b> 
include ministering to those who are dying, have been traumatized, or who are 
concerned about the destiny of their souls. Crucial visits are priority visits.</li>
<li><b><u>Needed visits</u></b> 
are not as time-sensitive or immediate. I suggest visiting before a significant 
surgery (usually the day before at home, since most folks enter the hospital the 
morning of their surgery). A visit a few days after surgery is often 
appreciated as well. For more info on frequency of visits, see section V, letter 
A. </li>
<li><b><u>Optional visits</u></b> 
include people who are only in the hospital for a day or two, women having 
babies, or stopping by someone I saw yesterday because I happen to be in the 
hospital the next day to visit someone else. If I choose to visit someone who 
is not part of the church family (perhaps a relative of someone who attends), 
that constitutes an optional visit. If someone from the church asks me to visit 
a relative (locally), I usually do so (one time only). If they say, &quot;If you are 
at the hospital and you'd like to drop in...&quot; I will visit them if I am in the 
hospital, but will not make a special trip.</p>
<p>I do not feel obligated to visit 
people outside our church family but will do so to maintain good relationships 
with those who are part of the church family. Occasionally you might have a 
church member who thinks you have nothing to do and are looking for people to 
visit. In that instance, you will need to inform the church member otherwise.</li>
<li><b><u>Token visits</u></b> 
involve making visits for no practical reason other than to please people, keep 
the peace, or satisfy tradition. You are not really ministering; you are not 
keeping people in touch with the church because token visits most often involve 
irregular attenders who do not really care that much about the church. A good 
example of a token visit would be when you are asked to visit a non-attending 
spouse who is having a heart catheterization. This patient has no interest in you 
or use for spiritual things, but his or her spouse thinks that this might 
provide an opportunity to witness. In rare instances, someone might actually be 
saved through such a visit, but typically the visit is token. I rarely volunteer 
to make token visits, but I have made hundreds of them over the years at the 
request of others. I now will only do this if the visit is local.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<b><li>Levels of Authority</b>
<ol type=A><li><b><u>Clergy (Pastor)</b></u> are 
	generally acknowledged by hospitals and are typically able to gain entrance 
	anywhere at anytime (if the patient wishes). Pastors who are local are 
	sometimes urged to view a video, etc. to orient them, but this is becoming 
	less common.</li>
	<li><b><u>Elder in lieu of a pastor</u></b> 
	may have a more difficult time getting into intensive care (other than 
	during family times) or getting admission apart from visiting hours. If you 
	are in this situation, it is good to explain that the pastor is out of town 
	and that you are a member of the church's ruling board. It doesn't hurt to 
	mention that you have received some training. If possible, visit during 
	standard visiting hours to avoid complications.</li>
	<li><b><u>Elder</u></b> who is just visiting 
	may find it easiest to work within visiting restrictions.</li>
	<li><b><u>Layman</u></b> (same advice as 
	above)</li>
	<ul type="disc">
		<li>Note: privacy laws are 
		goofy. If you go to the information desk and ask, &quot;Is Joe Cacutza 
		here?&quot; they will tell you that they are not allowed to say. But if you 
		say, &quot;I would like the room number for Joe Cacutza,&quot; they will give it to 
		you, but not if you asked that first question first! <b>So go with 
		confidence as though you are sure the patient is there</b>. If he has 
		gone home, all they will tell you is that, &quot;We have no one here by that 
		name.&quot;
		<p>Silly, ain't it?<p>&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<b><li>Description of A Typical Visit</b>
<p>You drop by the hospital and ask 
for the room number of John Doe. You take the elevator and locate his room. 
His door is opened, and so you find John's half of the room. If his curtain is 
pulled, you should ask him for permission to come in. If John's life is not 
hanging in the balance and he is sleeping lightly, you call his name or gently 
touch him. If he does not wake up, leave a note. If you have traveled a long 
way (e.g., Indianapolis), ask a nurse to wake him if it is advisable.</p>
<p>If he does not know you, 
introduce yourself and tell John that you are from Highland Park Church (do not 
just say, &quot;The Church;&quot; don't assume he knows). You mention how you came to 
hear that he was there, and then you ask, &quot;How are things going today?&quot; Do not 
ask, &quot;Why are you here?&quot; John may or may not tell you about his condition (maybe 
he has been castrated or has STD, or maybe a woman is having a partial 
hysterectomy, for example). Discuss what he wants to discuss. If he wants to 
tell you all the gory details, listen. If he seems uncomfortable with you, cut 
it short.</p>
<p>After discussion, read some 
Scripture (I love 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ps86.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Psalm 86</a>, 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ps27.htm')" target=_self class=pop>27</a> and 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/ps138.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Psalm 138</a>; 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/is402731.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Isaiah 40:27-31</a>
is special, as is 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/phil449.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Philippians 4:4-9</a>; 
if he is not a believer, I suggest 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john3118.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 3:1-18</a> or 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/john1417.htm')" target=_self class=pop>John 14:1-7</a>). 
<i>Avoid reading Psalm 23 (unless the patient is near death) because 
Psalm 23 has become associated with death and funerals.</i></p>
<p>Then I offer a brief prayer, 
praying for God's blessing upon him, the medical team, for God to prosper 
the treatment and to encourage his heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><li>Important Considerations and Etiquette</b>
<ol type=A><li><b><u>Considerations</u></b>
<p>During the first few years of my 
ministry, I would pray with people in their rooms the day of surgery. I would 
try to get there about 6 a.m. before they started injecting them with 
tranquilizers. As insurance companies and the government cut back, the entire 
equation changed. Patients now arrive in the surgery area that morning and are 
usually eager to be ushered right into wherever it is they must go. The pastor 
or visitor is often in the way, a person who delays the admission process.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that I hate to 
get up early in the morning, this change forced me to adjust my previous 
routine. I now try to meet with the patient at home the day (or sometimes two 
days) before surgery. Why sometimes two days? For some surgeries, the patient 
has to get an enema and take laxatives to clean them out. The resultant 
situation is not conducive to a visit!</p>
<p>If a surgery is particularly 
dangerous, I might stay with the family—or, if local, I check in and out. 
Otherwise I rarely sit with the family during surgery. </p>
<ol style=1><li><b><u>How long should you visit?</u></b> That depends. 
<b>The average hospital visit is probably 15 
minutes.</b> Here is a possible guide:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A stranger or person you barely 
	know: 10 minutes or less</li>
	<li>In intensive care: 5 minutes or 
	less</li>
	<li>A person you know who is in pain, 
	sleepy, or has company over: 5 minutes or less (You might stay longer if the 
	person is feeling well and has company, particularly if you know the 
	company.)</li>
	<li>A person you know who is alert, 
	not in great pain and feeling social: half an hour </li>
	<li>Vary with the situation: a widow without family who is feeling well 
	might enjoy your company more than someone who is getting more company than 
	they can handle....</li>
	<li>Pay attention to clues: yawning, 
	heavy eyelids, or verbal clues; as a rule of thumb, it is better to 
	under-stay than over-stay</li>
</ul>
<li><b><u>How often should you visit?</u></b>
	<ul>
		<li>For local hospitalization, I 
		visit patients twice a week (always at least once and sometimes three or 
		more times). </li>
		<li>If they are out of the area 
		(more than a 30 minute drive), I'll visit them once a week. If they are 
		in Indianapolis, I usually do not see them unless they are going to be 
		hospitalized for more than 4 days.</li>
		<li>If they are in an extended 
		care unit (a sort of in the hospital recovery/rehab facility), I'll 
		visit them once a week. </li>
		<li>If they are in a bad way or 
		near death (in intensive care, for example), I will usually visit them 
		daily and, if near the end, two, three, or even four times a day. If 
		death is at hand, I stay there.</li>
		<li>If people choose hospitals 
		(or nursing homes) out of our area, the consequence is that they are 
		less accessible. On the other hand, if they must be elsewhere (e.g., 
		car accident, life-lined, need a specialized treatment etc.), then we 
		must be willing to bite the time bullet.</li>
		<li>The visitor must flex with 
		the situation. It is good to have minimal guidelines, but one must be 
		willing to visit more often when one senses it is making a significant 
		difference (or the need is greater).</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<li><b><u>Etiquette</u></b></p>
<ol>
	<li>Do not sit on the bed</li>
	<li>Use caution in shaking/holding 
	hands; I often avoid doing so unless the person wants to; I might touch a 
	hand in a distressing situation. You do not want to interfere with IV's, 
	etc. and you don't want to spread germs to a person whose immune system 
	might be compromised</li>
	<li>Mealtimes happen. Cut your visit 
	short (less than 5 minutes) if the person is eating (unless they are nearly 
	done); you might offer to come back in 15 minutes, find a lounge and have a 
	devotional time, check out the gift shop, or read the paper.</li>
	<li>Medical people enter to do a 
	procedure from time to time; it is best to exit. &nbsp;If a therapist is coming 
	for therapy, etc, they will often give you 3 minutes to pray if you ask.</li>
	<li>Bedpan issues can be 
	embarrassing; if someone says they need to go, get out of there; do not make 
	them cringe. If the curtains are drawn as you enter the room, ask a nurse 
	if it is okay to go on that side of the room. If the person on the bedpan, 
	see #3 above.</li>
	<li>Appropriate and inappropriate 
	questions/comments. Do not ask them what their condition is, why they are 
	there, or if they think they are going to make it. </li>
	<li>Never minimize the comments 
	people make as though they have no right to have the feelings they have. 
	Encouraging denial is encouraging lying or going underground with one's 
	thoughts.</li>
<p>If they 
tell you they think they are going to die, they might be right (but they might 
be wrong). If someone says they are miserable, please, do not say, &quot;Well, it 
could be worse,&quot; or, &quot;Mrs. Jones has it worse.&quot; Finding comfort in another's 
misery is plain foolish.</p>
<p><i>Comment:</i> I think I am going to die.<br>
<i>Response:</i> I hope not, we would all miss 
you. I know you are ready to meet God (if the person is saved), but we would 
like to keep you with us longer.</p>
	<p><i>Comment:</i> Sometimes I wish God would take 
me. I'm no good here.<br>
	<i>Response:</i> I don't blame you. A lot of 
people feel that way, and you are not wrong to think that. Even Paul said he 
preferred to be absent from the body but present with the Lord. But God has 
reasons we do not understand, and God's ways are not the same as ours.</p>
	<p><i>Comment:</i> Sometimes I get mad at God 
because He allows me to go through this.<br>
	<i>Response:</i> Don't feel guilty about that. 
David wrote a lot of Psalms complaining to God because He felt the same way. 
Tell God exactly how you feel; He can take it.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
	<li>Sleeping patient issues are 
	common. If a person's life is not in the balance, I usually try to wake 
	them by calling their name or lightly touching their arm. If this does not 
	wake them, I assume they need the sleep more than my visit and I leave a 
	note (see section IV for exceptions).</li>
	<li>Visiting out of town? Call first 
	to be sure the patient will be in his/her room and is up to company. Why 
	drive an hour and a half to visit a patient who is so heavily sedated that 
	he or she will not even remember your visit?</li>
	<li>When you pray for the patient, 
	ask God to bless, comfort and heal his or her roommate as well.</li>
	<li>Things to pray for: God's peace, 
	wisdom for medical personnel, prospering of treatment, alleviation of pain, 
	God's will for healing.</li>
	<li>Do not visit if you have a cold 
	or contagious condition. A phone call is better in such cases. A patient's 
	health is more important.</li>
	<li>Focus on the patient unless the visit is long (longer visits might be 
	appropriate for old friends who are feeling well but are bored).</li>
	<li>Work around test and bath 
	schedules: afternoons or early evening are usually the best time to visit, 
	or very early morning 6:30 or 7.</li>
	<li>Avoid being a medical 
	know-it-all and do not put down a patient's doctors.</li>
	<li>Be alert. If patients eyes are 
	heavy, cut it short. If patient is nauseous, cut it short. If your 
	presence might embarrass a patient, make it short.</li>
	<li>If the door is closed, check at 
	the nurse's station before entering: someone may be on the bedpan or 
	receiving a bath or change of dressing.</li>
<li><u>Hospital Rules</u></p>
<ol type=a>
	<li>Privacy laws limit what they can 
	tell you at the desk or over the phone. Never ask, &quot;Is so and so there,&quot; 
	but I'd like the room number of...&quot; (or if on the phone, &quot;I'd like to speak 
	to a patient, Jack Sprat.&quot;)</li>
	<li>Volume issues: do not talk too 
	loudly, but loud enough for the patient to hear you.</li>
	<li>Number of visitors is sometimes 
	limited by hospitals to two at a time although this has become less common.</li>
	<li>Intensive care visits are usually 
	restricted to family only (except when death is imminent) for five minutes 
	on either odd or even hours; clergy can generally visit any time. But 
	remember, people who are in intensive care are there for a reason; keep 
	visits short.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</ol>
</ol>
<b><li>Hospital Areas</b>
<ol type=A>
	<li><u><b>Standard room, before surgery</b></u></li>
	<li><u><b>Standard room, after surgery</b></u></li>
	<li><u><b>Emergency room</b></u>: Sometimes, in 
	dire situations, I will stay with a family in the emergency room or waiting 
	room; often I have a 5 to 10 minute visit and leave; it depends who is there 
	(someone alone may appreciate your company) and the situation.</li>
	<li><u><b>Intensive care</b></u> means limited 
	access except for clergy; you really want to avoid getting in the way here.</li>
	<li><u><b>Hospice care</b></u> is a section for 
	those who are in the process of dying often of cancer.</li>
	<li><u><b>Deathbed situations</b></u> are hard to 
	call. I mostly visit in and out during the day/night and take my best guess 
	as to when death is near; I try to be present when the person actually dies 
	and for maybe an hour afterward (while the family grieves). Laymen, in a 
	pastor's absence, would be expected to stop in several times for maybe 15 
	minutes at a time. He might return (depending upon his schedule) when 
	called in at the point of—or immediately after—death. He should pray, 
	perhaps reading from 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/rom81839.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 8:18-39</a> or 
	<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1thes41317.htm')" target=_self class=pop>
	1 Thessalonians 4:13-17</a>
	and then offer prayer. I sometimes leave at that point, at other times I wait for the 
	undertaker. Every family expects or needs other things. Sometimes a 
	minister can be in the way or, while not in the way, not necessary either.</li>
	<li><u><b>Contamination hazards</b></u> may require 
	you to wear a robe, gloves, and/or a mask. As you leave, dispose of them in 
	the appropriate container and wash your hands with disinfectant soap. In 
	these instances, a sign is posted on the door. You can ask a nurse for 
	assistance.</li>
	<li><u><b>Psychiatric wards</b></u> are tough to 
	get into. Even family and clergy are only allowed to visit at the request 
	of the patient and then at certain hours (since patients are often 
	participating in group sessions). Laymen should probably not even attempt 
	to make these visits. Pastors should work through a family member for 
	direction.</li>
	<li><u><b>Maternity ward visits</b></u> are great 
	if you have time to make them, but I do not stress out my schedule to do 
	so. If there is a problem with the baby, they obviously become a 
	necessity. Because of issues like nursing babies, etc., I have long felt 
	that women friends are the best visitors in the maternity ward. When I 
	visit, I always knock first and I keep my visit brief. I never ask to hold 
	or touch a newborn. I offer prayer for mom, the family and the newborn.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<b><li>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The question still remains, 
&quot;Where do these rules come from?&quot; There is no ultimate authority when it comes 
to hospital visitation. Customs vary between regions and expectations vary from 
one congregation to another, from one generation to another. Unfortunately, 
much of this ministry is defined by the expectations of tradition and culture 
rather than reason and actual spiritual impact. Nonetheless, much (perhaps 
most) of the ministry of hospital visitation is valuable, in my view.</p>
<p><u><b>When people are 
hospitalized, they feel vulnerable and need the comfort of a church shepherd; 
they need to be pointed toward the Good Shepherd.</b></u></p>

<p><b><a name="appendix">Appendix: 
Anointing with Oil and Taking Communion</a></b></p>
<ol type="I">
<b><li>Anointing with Oil</b>
<p><b>James 5:13-16</b> is a text that 
raises many questions. It reads:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Is any one of you in trouble? He 
should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise. Is any one of you 
sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him 
with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the 
sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be 
forgiven. Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so 
that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and 
effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the style of Jesus when 
preaching the Sermon on the Mount, the book of James reduces things down to 
black and white and is far from complete in what it addresses. This is part of 
the Rabbinic &quot;Hot and Cold&quot; style of teaching and this style of teaching often 
raises more questions than it answers. It presents truth but not whole truth.</p>
<p>Very quickly, my understanding of 
the &quot;prayer of faith&quot; is that God gives that prayer (it is not conjured up by 
our own willpower or adrenaline).&nbsp; If He gives that prayer, the person will be 
healed. Some sickness may be a result of sin and so confession of sin to God—and 
a confession to a Christian confidant—may itself prevent some (though not 
most) sicknesses.</p>
<p>But our focus is the use of 
anointing while visiting in the hospital. I would suggest doing so as follows:</p>
<ol><li>The sick person (or a close 
family member) should request it.</p>
<li>The elders of the church 
should administer it. This would not necessarily require ALL the elders but at 
least two and preferably more.</p>
<li>Some interpreters understand 
oil to be one example of medicine and that James is talking about a combination 
of medicine and prayer. Although it is right for Christians to take medicine 
while also praying, I do not think that this is James' point.</p>
<li>Others see the oil as symbolic 
of the Holy Spirit. I believe this is more accurate. But some say that since 
the oil is symbolic, it is unnecessary. I have a problem with that reasoning. 
I am among those who believe that both baptism and the Lord's Supper are 
symbolic. Yet, because the symbol represents something greater does not mean we 
should eliminate the symbol. It is true that the symbols seen in the Law 
foreshadow the work of Christ, but we are not talking about Old Testament 
symbols. If God commands us to use the symbol, we should assume God knows what 
He is talking about and that the symbols are important. God is not out to 
entangle us with busywork. </p>
<li>How we do it, when we are 
called in (usually for a serious illness) is as follows: I (or any elder) rub a 
little olive oil on the forehead of the sick person. The elders lightly lay one 
hand on either the head or shoulders of the sick person and we each pray for 
God to heal that individual, according to His good will.</p>
<li>In my experience, I have noted 
one instance where God has miraculously healed a man with an irreversible 
disease (interstitial fibrosis). In other instances, I have noted no difference 
between prayers with anointing and other prayers. Still, it is important for us 
to obey God for no other reason than to obey. But there <i>are </i>other 
reasons: the rare instances of healing that may not occur otherwise, the 
blessing it is for the sick person to feel loved and the way it ministers to 
all (the sick person, his/her family and the elders themselves).
</ol>
<b><li>The Lord's Supper</b>
<p>Many churches have their 
own traditions regarding the Lord's Supper. I am writing primarily for independent 
churches who hold to 1) the priesthood of all believers and 2) the symbolic 
nature of the Lord's Supper.</p>
<p>In my view, any believer is free 
to celebrate the Lord's Supper with any other believer at any time. I have 
rarely celebrated communion with someone while in the hospital, though I have 
partaken of the Lord's supper many times with shut-ins at nursing homes or in 
their homes often around Good Friday.</p>
<p>Simply bring a couple of paper or 
disposable cups, some grape juice (or wine, if that is your custom) and some 
matzo (or oyster crackers). </p>
<ol><li>Read 
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/1cor112326.htm')" target=_self class=pop>1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>.</p>
<li>Have a moment of silent 
prayer to confess any sins and to prepare our hearts. Then offer a short prayer 
mentioning the broken body and shed blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<li>Distribute the bread saying 
something like, &quot;This pictures the Body of Christ; let's partake together.&quot; 
Then eat the bread.</p>
<li>Do the same with the cup 
saying, &quot;This cup is a picture of the Blood of Christ; let's partake together.&quot;</p>
<li>Close in prayer thanking God 
for the salvation these elements symbolize.</ol></ol>
