<p><sup>5</sup> If he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald 
of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the 
ungodly; <sup>6</sup> if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he 
condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to 
the ungodly; <sup>7</sup> and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the 
sensual conduct of the wicked <sup>8</sup> (for as that righteous man lived among 
them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds 
that he saw and heard); <sup>9</sup> then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly 
from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of 
judgment</p>
