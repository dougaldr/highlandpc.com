<p><sup>6</sup> One day the angels came to present themselves before the L<span>ORD</span>,
and Satan also came with them.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup> The L<span>ORD</span> said to Satan, &quot;Where
have you come from?&quot;</p>

<p>Satan answered the L<span>ORD</span>, &quot;From roaming through the earth and going back
and forth in it.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> Then the L<span>ORD</span>  said to Satan, &quot;Have you considered my
servant Job?&nbsp; There is no one on earth like him; he is&nbsp; blameless and
upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>9</sup> &quot;Does Job fear God for nothing?&quot; Satan replied.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup>
&quot;Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he
has?&nbsp; You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are
spread throughout the land.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup> But stretch our your hand and strike
everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> The L<span>ORD</span>  said to Satan, &quot;Very well, then, everything he
has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.&quot; </p>

<p>Then Satan went out from the presence of the L<span>ORD</span>.</p>
