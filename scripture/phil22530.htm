<p><sup>25</sup> But I think it is necessary to send back to 
you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your 
messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. <sup>26</sup> For 
he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
<sup>27</sup> Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had 
mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon 
sorrow. <sup>28</sup> Therefore I am all the more eager to send 
him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.
<sup>29</sup> Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor 
men like him, <sup>30</sup> because he almost died for the work 
of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me. </p>
