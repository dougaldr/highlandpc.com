<p><sup>10</sup> David said, "O L<span>ORD</span>, God of Israel, your servant has heard 
definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account 
of me. <sup>11</sup> Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will 
Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O L<span>ORD</span>, God of Israel, tell your 
servant."
<p>And the L<span>ORD</span> said, "He will."
<p><sup>12</sup> Again David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah surrender 
me and my men to Saul?"
<p>And the L<span>ORD</span> said, "They will." 
<p><sup>13</sup> So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left 
Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had 
escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
