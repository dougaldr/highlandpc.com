<p><sup>26</sup> “So if anyone tells you, ‘There he is, out 
in the desert,’ do not go out; or, ‘Here he is, in the inner rooms,’ do not 
believe it. <sup>27</sup> For as lightning that comes from the 
east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
<sup>28</sup> Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures 
will gather.” </p>
<p><sup>29</sup> “Immediately after the distress of those 
days ‘the sun will be darkened, 
and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky,
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’”
</p>
<p><sup>30</sup> “At that time the sign of the Son of Man 
will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will 
see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.” </p>
