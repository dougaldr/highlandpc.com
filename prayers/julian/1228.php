<p>Lord,</p>
<p>Thank You that You are the God of mercy! Like the 
Psalmist, I can pray, &quot;Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in You my 
soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of Your wings until the 
disaster has passed&quot; (<b>Psalm 57:1</b>).</p>
<p>The imagery is just what I need. As a mother hen shelters 
her chicks under her wings, so You shelter me when life is overbearing or 
disaster is near. And Lord, it warms my heart to know that you are comforting 
millions of Your children in this world at any given moment. You have comforted 
Your children ever since this world of ours was cursed. Thank You for being 
there for us!</p>
<p>Father, I have so many things I think I should do: chores 
around the house, errands to run, things to clean or organize, people I really 
should invite over, assignments I should be working on, matters of exercise or 
diet.... O Lord, sometimes I am overwhelmed and do not know where to begin. I 
always feel behind, under the pile and crave a simpler life. Yet, on the other 
hand, I need purpose and dislike being bored. Help me to accept that it is a 
no-win situation and that most of us struggle with these same things. So give me 
peace and guidance. Help me to prioritize responsibilities and choices based 
upon Your will. Let me take time to smell the roses.</p>
<p>Lord, I am thankful for many things two of which are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I present myself before You; may Your Spirit fill me. 
I trust in His power, not my own. I surrender control of my life to Your Spirit 
today.</p>
<p>I pray for the Indonesian island of Java with its 125 
million people! While fewer than 3% of the population would call themselves 
born-again evangelical Christians, that number represents great growth. O God, 
please keep working mightily in this region! Thank You for the cooperation 
between believers. Lord, may the percentage of those who know You double over 
the next decade, I pray.</p>
<p>Praise Your Name for Operation Mobilization with &quot;over 
4,000 people working in over 100 countries are serving with Operation 
Mobilization to bring a message of hope to the peoples of the world.... Working 
in every continent and on every ocean (via two ocean-going ships), Operation 
Mobilization seeks to demonstrate and proclaim the love of God.... Through 
literature, the creative arts, friendship, Bible studies, videos and cassette 
tapes, correspondence courses, relief and development work...by all means 
possible [they] will tell people how...lives have been changed...and how they 
can meet Jesus.&quot;</p>
<p>Empower these missionaries by Your Spirit, grant them 
harmony, safety, provision and Your wisdom.</p>
<p>I pray for the world's diplomats. I pray that they might 
find fair and peaceful solutions to the constant barrage of conflicts we face.</p>
<p>So I commit the next 24 hours to You, dear Lord, in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
