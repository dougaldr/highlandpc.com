<p>
<sup>1 Timothy </sup></p>

<p>
<sup>1:</sup><sup>5</sup>The goal of this command is love, which comes from a
pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</p>

<p>
<sup>1:7</sup>They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what
they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.<br>
<sup>8</sup>We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.</p>

<p>
<sup>1:10b</sup>and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine <sup>11</sup>that
conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</p>

<p>
<sup>3:2</sup>Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one
wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach</p>

<p>
<sup>4:6</sup>If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good
minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good
teaching that you have followed. <sup>7</sup>Have nothing to do with godless
myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.</p>

<p>
<sup>4:13</sup>Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture,
to preaching and to teaching.</p>

<p>
<sup>4:16</sup>Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because
if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.</p>

<p>
<sup>5:17</sup>The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy
of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching. <sup>18</sup>For
the Scripture says, &quot;Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the
grain,&quot; and &quot;The worker deserves his wages.&quot;</p>

<p>
<sup>6:2d</sup>These are the things you are to teach and urge on them.<br>
<br>
<sup>6:3</sup>If anyone teaches false doctrines and does not agree to the sound
instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, <sup>4a</sup>he is
conceited and understands nothing.</p>

<p>
<sup>6:20</sup>Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away
from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge</p>

<p>
<sup>2 Timothy</sup></p>

<p>
<sup>1:</sup><sup>13</sup>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound
teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>
<sup>2:2</sup>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many
witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.</p>

<p>
<sup>2:15</sup>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a
workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of
truth.</p>

<p>
<sup>2:24</sup>And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind
to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. <sup>25</sup>Those who oppose him he
must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading
them to a knowledge of the truth</p>

<p>
<sup>3:10a</sup>You, however, know all about my teaching.</p>

<p>
<sup>3:14</sup>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become
convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, <sup>15</sup>and
how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you
wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup>16</sup>All Scripture is
God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in
righteousness, <sup>17</sup>so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped
for every good work.</p>

<p>
<sup>4:2</sup>Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct,
rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. <sup>3</sup>For
the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine.</p>

<p>
<sup>Titus</sup></p>

<p>
<sup>1:9</sup>He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been
taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who
oppose it.</p>

<p>
<sup>2:1</sup>You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.</p>
