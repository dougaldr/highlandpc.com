<p><sup>4</sup> In your struggle against sin, you have not resisted to the point
of shedding your blood.&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> And you have forgotten that word of
encouragement that addresses you as sons:</p>

<p>&quot;My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose
heart when he rebukes you, <sup>6</sup> because the Lord disciplines those he
loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons.&nbsp;
For
what son is not disciplined by his father?&nbsp; <sup>8</sup> If you are not
disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate
children and not true sons.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> Moreover, we have all had human fathers
who disciplined us and we respected them for it.&nbsp; How much more should we submit
to the Father of our spirits and live!&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> Our fathers disciplined us
for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good,
that we may share in his holiness.&nbsp; <sup>11</sup> No discipline seems pleasant at
the time, but painful.&nbsp; Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness
and peace for those who have been trained by it.</p>
