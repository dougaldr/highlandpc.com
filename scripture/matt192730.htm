<p><sup>27</sup> Peter answered him, &quot;We have left everything to follow
you! What then will there be for us?&quot;</p>

<p><sup>28</sup> Jesus said to them, &quot;I tell you the truth, at the renewal
of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have
followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of
Israel.&nbsp; <sup>29</sup> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or
father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times
as much and will inherit eternal life.&nbsp; <sup>30</sup> But many who are first will
be last, and many who are last will be first.&quot;</p>
