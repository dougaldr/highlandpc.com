<p><sup>12</sup> He did not enter by means of the 
blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by 
his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
<sup>13</sup> The blood of goats and bulls and 
the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify 
them so that they are outwardly clean. <sup>14</sup> How 
much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit 
offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead 
to death, so that we may serve the living God! 
<p>&nbsp;<sup>15</sup> For this reason Christ is the 
mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised 
eternal inheritance—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the 
sins committed under the first covenant.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> For Christ did not enter a manmade sanctuary that was only a
copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's
presence.&nbsp; <sup>25</sup> Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and
again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood
that is not his own.&nbsp; <sup>26</sup> Then Christ would have had to suffer many
times since the creation of the world.&nbsp; But now he has appeared once for all at
the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup>
Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, <sup>28</sup>
so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will
appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are
waiting for him.</p>
