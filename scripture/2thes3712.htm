<p><sup>7 </sup>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We
were not idle when we were with you, <sup>8 </sup>nor did we eat anyone's food
without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and
toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. <sup>9 </sup>We did
this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make
ourselves a model for you to follow.&nbsp; <sup>10</sup> For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: &quot;If
a man will not work, he shall not eat.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>11</sup> We hear that some among you are idle.&nbsp; They are not busy; they
are busybodies.&nbsp; <sup>12</sup> Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus
Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.</p>
