<p><sup>2</sup> And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, &quot;Who
is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?&quot;&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> But no one
in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look
inside it.&nbsp; <sup>4</sup> I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy
to open the scroll or look inside.&nbsp; <sup>5</sup> Then one of the elders said to
me, &quot;Do not weep!&nbsp; See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David,
has triumphed.&nbsp; He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.&quot;</p>
