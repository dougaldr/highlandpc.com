<br>Church Size Makes a Difference
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>When you&#39;ve been pastoring a church for 21 years, you begin 
to notice patterns and recurring issues. One area of adjustment many folks have 
to make relates to the size of our church.</p>

<p>For some people, ours is a large congregation. For others, 
it's a tiny flock. And, like Goldilocks and the Three Bears, for others, our 
size is &#34;just right.&#34; God has different purposes for different churches. Some 
churches are very similar to ours when it comes to basic beliefs, though few 
have the same emphasis. Some of these churches are much larger than ours, while 
others are quite small. Our church used to be smaller. When I began in 1983, we 
averaged about 75 per Sunday. We can now honestly say we run about 200 per 
Sunday. Obviously we have not grown overnight.</p>

<p>What many people do not realize, however, is that church size 
is more than how many bodies fill an auditorium. The entire dynamic of a 
congregation is affected by size. Generally speaking, larger churches offer more 
choices and more programs, while smaller churches are more personable and 
relational. A church our size is still considered small by many authorities, an 
average attendance of 300 being considered the threshold for medium. One church 
in Kokomo has a youth group that is larger than our entire congregation!</p>

<p>Because we are not too large, I can eventually get to know 
everyone who attends here regularly, although I am slow at remembering names. I 
need to see them written down.</p>

<p>Because we are not too small, we offer a number of programs 
and ministries. But, compared to our past, we are larger than we used to be. 
With growth comes the creation of layers of ministry, and with additional 
ministry, the rules change.</p>

<p>We cannot do as many things on a whim. For example, we could not plan a 
Wednesday night special meeting with a guest missionary a few weeks in advance.
If we did such a thing, we would have to plan it months in advance to 
accommodate our AWANA Clubs and our SOL Bible Study. The AWANA schedule for the
September-April year is usually completed in July. Because our church is making 
more of a difference than we ever have and lots of activities take place here 
during the week, we can no longer assume that a weekday afternoon is &#34;dead time&#34;
round these parts. As a matter of fact, assumptions are what get us in trouble!</p>

<p>I remember a number of years ago, we lent out most of our 
tables for another event here in town. Then we were hit with a surprise funeral 
dinner and had to use old ping-pong tables and other ragtag tables. We then 
learned to limit how many tables we would lend out because we never know when 
the unexpected will come our way. </p>

<p>When our church was smaller, it was easier to plan events 
with less lead-time. Take Sunday nights. Five years ago, we could have planned a 
dinner a week in advance and all would be well. But now we have a really good 
Sunday night BASIC youth meeting and a really good Creation Club for younger 
youth, plus nursery workers to consider. People who are serving do not like 
things just dropped on them without advance notice.</p>

<p>Four years ago, folks who were planning to do special music 
could practice in the auditorium at 8:30 that morning. Now we have an early 
service at that time. We have worked hard to include participants in our 10:30 
service, whether in the realm of music, drama, liturgical dance, etc. This 
requires planning services or events sometimes months in advance.</p>

<p>When I first came to HPC, if I preached ten minutes over, it 
did not make a big difference. A few folks would be displeased because they were 
not sure they could beat the restaurant rush, but that was about it. Now if I 
preach ten minutes over, I have inconvenienced the nursery workers, and our 
three sets of Children&#39;s Church teachers have to keep young, active minds busy 
for ten more minutes when they know they should be &#34;free&#34;.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that we are finding new applications for 
<b>Philippians 2:4</b>, &#34;Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to 
the interests of others.&#34; We have learned to be team players rather than rugged 
individuals. Because we are a team, we are having more impact for the Kingdom 
than we ever have. Believe me, making a few adjustments is worth it to actually 
DO ministry, building relationships with more people and influencing our 
community for Christ. </p>

<p>So, those of you who have a large church background, you will 
notice that we do not have as much red tape as you might be used to. We are more 
relaxed and inclusive. If, on the other hand, your church background is from a 
very small congregation, we are more organized and have to do more coordinating 
than your previous experience. But I think for a church of our size, we do a 
lot. Most of you are involved in volunteering in some ministry here. My pastor 
buddies are jealous. Okay, so I like to brag. Want to make something of it? Oh, 
yeah, I forgot, <b>Philippians 2:4</b>. Sorry.</p>
