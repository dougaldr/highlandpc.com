<p>Have you ever noticed this verse about John sneaking Peter into the courtyard (where 
Peter denied Christ three times)? <b>John 
18:15-16</b>, “Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this 
disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's 
courtyard, but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who 
was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and 
brought Peter in.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why 
did John have this influence with the high priest? Although there are several 
possibilities, one seems most likely: John was related to the high priest. 
Although the evidence is questionable, Dr. Ron Moseley points to these verses 
from Acts:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Acts 4:5-7</b> “The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met 
in Jerusalem. Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, 
Alexander and the other men of the high priest's family. They had Peter and 
John brought before them and began to question them:’ By what power or what name 
did you do this?’”</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Additionally, Moseley adds the stronger evidence from Easter Sunday’s events. 
<b>John 20:5-6</b>, “He [John] bent over and looked 
in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. Then Simon Peter, who 
was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen 
lying there....”</p>
<p></p>
<p>We 
can understand WHY John would have hesitated entering the tomb if he was of 
priestly lineage: contact with a dead body would defile him. Whether or not 
John, who was the youngest of the Apostles and possibly as young as 19, was 
related to the high priest, he does use his clout to sneak Peter into the 
courtyard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A few 
other points worth noting regarding the meeting of the Jewish ruling council, 
the Sanhedrin. In this illegal, corrupt trial of Jesus, the high priest seems 
to be leading the council instead of its official ruler, the highly revered and 
very ethical Gamaliel. It is also likely that council member Nicodemus was not 
invited to this sham of a meeting because he had demonstrated leanings toward 
Jesus. Joseph of Arimathea had been a silent disciple of Jesus, so the others 
did invite him. He demonstrated his faith by opposing their rulings. In <b>Luke 
23:50-51</b>, we read, “....Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, 
who had not consented to their decision and action....”</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Trials at night were illegal. A criminal could not be executed for at least 
three days after sentencing. But this is scheme, not justice; just leaders were 
not knowingly invited to this sordid event.</p>
