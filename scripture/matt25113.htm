<p><sup>1</sup> “At that time the kingdom of heaven will be 
like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
<sup>2</sup> Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
<sup>3</sup> The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take 
any oil with them. <sup>4</sup> The wise, however, took oil in 
jars along with their lamps. <sup>5</sup> The bridegroom was a 
long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.” </p>
<p><sup>6</sup> “At midnight the cry rang out: ‘Here's the 
bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’” </p>
<p><sup>7</sup> “Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed 
their lamps. <sup>8</sup> The foolish ones said to the wise, 
‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’” </p>
<p><sup>9</sup> “ ‘No,’ they replied, ‘there may not be 
enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for 
yourselves.’” </p>
<p><sup>10</sup> “But while they were on their way to buy 
the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to 
the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.” </p>
<p><sup>11</sup> “Later the others also came. ‘Sir! Sir!’ 
they said. ‘Open the door for us!’” </p>
<p><sup>12</sup> “But he replied, ‘I tell you the truth, I 
don't know you.’” </p>
<p><sup>13</sup> “Therefore keep watch, because you do not 
know the day or the hour.” </p>
