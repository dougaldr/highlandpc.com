<p><sup>18</sup> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the
godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, <sup>19</sup>
since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it
plain to them.&nbsp; <sup>20</sup> For since the creation of the world God's invisible
qualities&#151;his eternal power and divine nature&#151;have been clearly seen, being
understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</p>

<p><sup>21</sup> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God
nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish
hearts were darkened.&nbsp; <sup>22</sup> Although they claimed to be wise they became
fools <sup>23</sup> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made
to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their
hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.&nbsp;
<sup>25</sup>
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created
things rather than the Creator&#151;who is forever praised. Amen.</p>

<p><sup>26</sup> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.&nbsp; Even
their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup> In the
same way the men also abandoned natural relations with woman and were inflamed
with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and
received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</p>
