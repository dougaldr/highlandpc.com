<br>The Primacy of Parents in Youth Discipleship
<br><span class=byln>by Matthew Hoskinson</span></p>

<p>Scripture affirms two 
key truths that must drive the way families and churches disciple the next 
generation. Errors emerge when one truth is distorted and emphasized to the 
neglect of the other. But seeking to maintain both emphases is imperative if we 
are to carry out God's ministry God's way.</p>
<p>Today we will examine 
the first key truth: <b>parents are 
primarily responsible for discipling their children</b>. 
From <b>Deuteronomy 6</b> to <b>Ephesians 6</b>, the Bible makes it clear: fathers and mothers 
must own up to the responsibility of rearing God-saturated children. Moses 
commanded Israel to &quot;teach them [God's words] diligently to...[their] 
children&quot; (<b>Deuteronomy 6:7</b>). And lest the community should think that all of the 
adults were primarily responsible for teaching all of the children, Moses added, 
&quot;Talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when 
you lie down, and when you rise&quot; (<b>6:7</b>). While there was a general community 
obligation to the next generation, Moses indisputably laid the primary 
responsibility on parents. Paul expressed it similarly in <b>Ephesians 6</b>. The 
apostle admonished parents to &quot;bring [their children] up in the discipline and 
instruction of the Lord&quot; (<b>v. 4</b>). He directed the command specifically to the 
fathers, not because mothers are relieved of the duty but because fathers are 
the &quot;heads of households on whom the ultimate responsibility for supervision 
rests&quot; (D. Edmund Hiebert,<i> Ephesians</i>, 
p. 108). The apostle affirms the teaching of Moses: parents--and especially 
fathers--are primarily responsible.</p>
<p>God did not give these 
commands in academic vacuums. Significantly, the commands of Moses and Paul both 
grow out of key statements of theology. Moses began with that great affirmation 
known as the Sh'ma: &quot;Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one&quot; (<b>Deuteronomy 
6:4</b>). There is none like Yahweh. His holiness means that He transcends the 
created order.</p>
<p>The character of God and the promises of God in Christ demand that parents 
take their responsibility for the next generation seriously. The call of the 
Great Commission--&quot;disciple the 
nations&quot; (<b>Matthew 28:19</b>, my translation)--must not be limited to the regions 
beyond. It begins at home. I have no greater opportunity--nor any greater 
responsibility--than to cultivate a follower of Christ in my own home with my own 
children. As a parent, I must meditate on the greatness and goodness of God, 
give great attention to my responsibility in light of His character and works, 
and then structure my family's existence around Him. As a pastor, I must 
proclaim the greatness and goodness of God, confront parents with their 
responsibility to their children early and often, and then structure our youth 
discipleship in a way that communicates the primacy of parents' responsibility.</p>
<p>The implications of this 
line of thinking are far-reaching. (1) If parents are primarily responsible for 
the discipleship of the next generation, then having a youth pastor is 
unnecessary. Many churches assume that the second pastoral staff member to be 
added to the payroll of a growing church ought to be the &quot;youth and music guy.&quot; 
There is in this assumption the tacit belief: &quot;if the next generation is to turn 
out right, the church must have an individual who is devoted full-time to 
students.&quot; The position of youth pastor may be helpful but isn't necessary for 
the discipleship of the coming generation. Having parents who are committed to 
the glory of God is.</p>
<p>(2) If parents are 
primarily responsible for the discipleship of the next generation and if a 
church chooses to have a youth pastor, then that man ought to view his primary 
ministry as complementing what the parents are (or ought to be) doing in the 
home. I appreciate the way that elders at my church altered the definition of my 
job. Originally, they sought a youth pastor who would be &quot;responsible for 
maintaining an effective youth ministry for the parents of Heritage Bible Church 
and their teens that reflects the character of God.&quot; There are some strong 
points to that definition. But over time--and long before I started in this 
position--they reconsidered the scriptural emphases, changed the title of the job 
to &quot;Pastor of Youth and Young Adults,&quot; and reworded the definition of the job to 
say that he is &quot;responsible to assist families in the discipling of youth and 
young adults to the end that they might grow up into Christ, worship God, and 
enjoy him forever.&quot; This means that we must work to know the parents and help 
them own their responsibility to their sons and daughters.</p>
<p>(3) If parents are 
primarily responsible for the discipleship of the next generation, then those 
who direct church-wide youth discipleship should factor the role of parents into 
their calendar. When churches schedule teen activities every Saturday night, we 
remove them from the ones who are primarily responsible for their 
discipleship--and often on the only free night on a family's calendar. I am not 
advocating the wholesale removal of youth group activities; I am arguing that 
leaders must evaluate the busyness of school schedules and extracurricular 
activities in light of the parents' responsibility when they set their monthly 
calendar of youth activities.</p>
<p>(4) If parents are 
primarily responsible for the discipleship of the next generation, then parents 
must be the first ones to staff all children's discipleship initiatives. 
Consequently, if we do not have enough parental volunteers to lead and staff a 
ministry initiative, we must make the difficult choice to cut that ministry.</p>
<p>So does this all mean 
that the church now operates at the whim of parents? Are church gatherings mere 
fixin's on the smorgasbord of life from which families may take a little of this 
and a little of that? This is the conclusion of some. But that is to deny the 
second scriptural emphasis, one that the next article in this series will 
address.</p>
<p>One last question is 
sure to arise: what about those children and teenagers who do not have believing 
parents? For now, let it suffice to say what is most readily apparent: the 
church must take on a critical role in their discipleship. We cannot exhort 
parents to disciple their children when they themselves are not followers of 
Christ. So it is wise to surround these children with other stable families, to 
encourage believing families to incorporate them into their lives, and to help 
build strong peer-to-peer and mentor-to-child relationships. This task should 
not fall on one person but should be the shared responsibility of many families.</p>
<p>For a large number of 
our youth--the majority in most congregations--reaching teens whose parents are 
unbelievers is not the emphasis. Our priority must be to stress that the weight 
of responsibility to disciple our youth falls upon their parents. Those of us 
who serve in leadership capacities must communicate their obligation to every 
kind of family in our church: from the empty-nesters with grandchildren on the 
way to the overjoyed parents of a newborn. With responsibilities clearly 
delineated, the people of the church can begin discipling the next generation 
for the glory of God.</p>
