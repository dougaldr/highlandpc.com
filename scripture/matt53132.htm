<p><sup>31</sup> It has been said, &quot;Anyone who divorces his wife must give
her a certificate of divorce.&quot;&nbsp; <sup>32</sup> But I tell you that anyone who
divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an
adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.</p>
