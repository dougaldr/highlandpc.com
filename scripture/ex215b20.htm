<p><sup>15b</sup> Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, 
where he sat down by a well. <sup>16</sup> Now a priest of Midian had seven 
daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their 
father's flock. <sup>17</sup> Some shepherds came 
along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered 
their flock. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> When the girls returned to 
Reuel their father, he asked them, &quot;Why have you returned so early today?&quot; </p>
<p><sup>19</sup> They answered, &quot;An Egyptian 
rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.&quot; 
</p>
<p><sup>20</sup> &quot;And where is he?&quot; he asked his 
daughters. &quot;Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat.&quot; </p>
