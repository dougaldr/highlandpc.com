<p><sup>12</sup> Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 
"Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the 
foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death."</p>
<p><sup>21</sup> And the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> said to him, "Go down 
and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the 
L<span class="sm">ORD</span> and many of them perish. <sup>22</sup> Even 
the priests, who approach the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, must consecrate 
themselves, or the L<span class="sm">ORD</span> will break out against them."</p>

<p><sup>23</sup> Moses said to the L<span class="sm">ORD</span>, "The people 
cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around 
the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"</p>
