<br>The Power of Permission
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>It is kind of funny, but even we grownups are frequently 
looking for permission. What do I mean by permission? Webster defines 
permission as &quot;formal consent or authorization.&quot; But there is another type of 
permission that I will call &quot;sociological permission.&quot;</p>
<p>For example, many women in the 1920's probably thought of 
the idea of wearing pants. It wasn't until the 1960's, however, when most women 
felt like they had &quot;permission&quot; to do so.</p>
<p>Many of us were discreetly patriotic before the terrorist 
attack we now refer to as &quot;9/11.&quot; Since that event, we now have permission to 
display our patriotism without embarrassment. We will not be socially 
castigated nor looked down upon as we might have been before 9/11.</p>
<p>When it comes to the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; movement, the 
idea that creation is too complex to have occurred by chance, many scientists 
would flock to this viewpoint because it is where the facts obviously lead. But 
the peer pressure is too great. The leading scientists refuse to give 
permission to their peers, and so they cling to the impossibility of random 
events resulting in...you.</p>
<p>Pastors tend to get permission from other pastors. In a 
previous article, I mentioned that Rick Warren is a major &quot;permission giver&quot; 
whereas some other big-name pastors (whose names I'll refrain from mentioning) 
thrive upon being permission &quot;withholders.&quot; They love to scold.</p>
<p>At a Moody Pastor's Conference, one of my favorite speakers 
of all time was speaking, Howard Hendricks. Howie stated, &quot;Some of you look 
sleepy. If you fall asleep during the sermon, don't try to wake yourself up and 
then nod off again. Don't fight it. Sleep freely, just don't snore!&quot;</p>
<p>In essence, there are two kinds of Christians who hold 
convictions: (1) scolders/legalists who, even if they were unsaved, would still 
be scolders and rule-bound, and (2) non-scolders who are conservative because 
their convictions demand it. In other words, some conservative evangelicals are 
conservatives because it is their personality or upbringing that made them such, 
while others are conservative DESPITE their personalities or upbringing 
precisely because they have convictions. I consider myself in that latter 
category, as are many of you.</p>
<p>And that is where the idea of &quot;grace&quot; comes into play. 
Scolders try to manipulate others by guilt and fail to realize that such 
manipulation rarely works. Permission-givers only play the guilt card when 
issues of truth or decency are at stake.</p>
<p>But permission givers can also challenge Christians toward 
new heights. In our recent series in Philippians, we saw how Paul's example of 
faithfully serving Christ in chains gave others permission to serve the Lord 
more boldly, to &quot;jump in with both feet.&quot; Rather than try to coerce unwilling 
participation, permission givers take along those who are eager to serve the 
Lord while encouraging and welcoming those who have been on the sidelines, the 
wonderful phenomenon of the &quot;late bloomer.&quot; Such late bloomers would never 
develop under the leadership of scolders, because scolders demand their pound of 
flesh, thus intimidating others.</p>
<p>So the question we need to ask ourselves is this: are we 
permission givers, or are we scolders? And if we are permission givers, can we 
say &quot;no&quot; and be firm when we need to be? Permission from a weak man or woman is 
not real permission at all; it is, instead, permissiveness.</p>
<p>And if we are scolders, when are we going to learn that 
scolding does nothing positive? Scolding is an impoverished form of discipline 
that merely humiliates others. Confrontation is a great art and can get quite 
uncomfortable, but scolding does not so much discipline as damage. In child 
rearing, for example, I would recommend a modest whack on the bottom to a <i>
blitzkrieg</i> of painful words.</p>
<p>People are always asking us for permission. When Sally 
shares, &quot;Sis, I am torn between coming to your birthday party or spending more 
time with my husband,&quot; Sally is begging to be told, &quot;Stay home and spend time 
with him. I don't mind.&quot; What would you tell Sally?</p>
<p>When Ziggy tells his pastor, &quot;My brother from New York is 
in this weekend for the first time in five years. We always golfed together, 
but I am having a hard time scheduling a time with him except for Sunday 
morning,&quot; Ziggy is dying to hear: &nbsp;&quot;Go with my blessing. Have a good time.&quot;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You see, no matter how old we get, we still sometimes need 
a sense of permission. So recognize that need and do not be oblivious to it. 
Be a man or woman of grace.</p>
