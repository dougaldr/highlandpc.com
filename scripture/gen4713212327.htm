<p><sup>13</sup> There was no food, however, in the 
whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away 
because of the famine. <sup>14</sup> Joseph 
collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for 
the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace.
<sup>15</sup> When the money of the people of 
Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, &quot;Give us food. Why 
should we die before your eyes? Our money is used up.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>16</sup> &quot;Then bring your livestock,&quot; 
said Joseph. &quot;I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your 
money is gone.&quot; <sup>17</sup> So they brought 
their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, 
their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through 
that year with food in exchange for all their livestock. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> When that year was over, they 
came to him the following year and said, &quot;We cannot hide from our lord the fact 
that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing 
left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
<sup>19</sup> Why should we perish before your 
eyes—we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we 
with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live 
and not die, and that the land may not become desolate.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>20</sup> So Joseph bought all the land 
in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the 
famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh's,
<sup>21</sup> and Joseph reduced the people to 
servitude, from one end of Egypt to the other.</p>
<p><sup>23</sup> Joseph said to the people, &quot;Now 
that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so 
you can plant the ground. <sup>24</sup> But when 
the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may 
keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and 
your children.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> &quot;You have saved our lives,&quot; 
they said. &quot;May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to 
Pharaoh.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>26</sup> So Joseph established it as a 
law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce 
belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become 
Pharaoh's. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>27</sup> Now the Israelites settled in 
Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful 
and increased greatly in number. </p>
