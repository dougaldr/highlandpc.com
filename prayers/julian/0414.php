<br>April 14

<p>King of the Universe,</p>
<p>You foresee all things. You anticipate everything. You are 
not some sort of soothsayer, nor are You an analyst charting trends and historic 
patterns. You know everything beforehand as though it had already happened. 
Even when You inspired the prophets, You often had them predict the future as 
though it were in the past tense. That is how sure You are about everything. 
Your knowledge of the future is as sure as Your knowledge of the past. You are 
never surprised even though You relate to us within the context of the created 
entity of time. You condescend to our thinking, but You know all things for all 
time.</p>
<p>I so appreciate the purifying ministry of the Holy Spirit. 
When I confess my sins, He purifies me. The spiritual germs that were infecting 
my soul are destroyed; I am clean again. Just as Jesus washed Peter's feet but 
refused His request to wash the rest of Him, so we Who know Christ are clean 
before You. Yet, as we live life, our feet become soiled; we sin. When we 
confess our sin, Your Spirit cleanses us much like Jesus washed Peter's feet. 
Thank You Lord that even though I still sin, I am clean before my Lord.</p>
<p>I pray for my pastor, staff, church board leaders, 
officers and teachers. If any do not know You, may they become born-again. 
Help them to be true to the Bible and to put Your Word over their own personal 
agendas. Help them to have genuine integrity, Biblical convictions, love, 
wisdom and courage. Help them put their walk with You first, their families 
second and their ministries third. Do not allow others to intimidate them into 
neglecting their families and remind them &quot;the fear of man works a snare.&quot; 
Help them be most concerned about pleasing You while also seeking peace and 
harmony within the congregation.</p>
<p>Help me love my brothers and sisters in Christ, but do not 
allow me to become naïve. When it comes to business, help me get things in 
writing, etc., not only to protect myself, but also to help fellow believers to 
be responsible.</p>
<p>Thank You for the 1.4% of the population who are born-again 
evangelicals in the tiny British overseas territory of Gibraltar next to 
Spain. We know many people travel to this land, mostly tourists and those 
working in the tourist industry including many Moroccans. The few churches 
there have the potential to reach people from many nations. Please revive the 
church there, and give them a vision for outreach. Empower them by Your Spirit.</p>
<p>I remember the ministry of 
Middle East Media in prayer. They are a &quot;unique, strategic...ministry producing 
many different bible-based publications and programs for distribution and 
broadcast through...media. With a focus on North Africa, the Arab Peninsula and 
the Middle East, MEM specializes in producing high quality family TV programming 
and magazines....&quot; Their vision is, &quot;to make the Gospel of Jesus Christ accessible 
to every family in the Middle East by the year 2020.&quot; We pray that they will 
succeed in this vision by Your Spirit. Grant them safety, harmony, 
effectiveness and provide for them. May Your Spirit prepare hearts and draw 
them to Christ through this work.</p>
<p>Bless those who work as real 
estate agents. Help them truly serve their clients, to be fair and helpful. 
May those Who know You exemplify Your character, share their testimonies when 
appropriate and we pray that many more in this field would come to know You.</p>
<p>I ask for Your direction 
today, in the Savior's Name, Amen.</p>
