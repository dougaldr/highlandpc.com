<br>January 28

<p>God of Infinity,</p>
<p>I remember as a child trying to understand what it meant to 
be invisible. How could You be present with me, and yet I cannot see You? 
Although my vocabulary has grown, I still marvel that You are the King eternal, 
immortal, and invisible. You are not subject to the laws of physics that 
restrain and restrict Your creation. We do not see You, we do not physically 
feel You, nor do we audibly hear You. We know that one day our bodies will be 
transformed into spiritual bodies like that of the resurrected Christ. We look 
forward to seeing Your invisible glory one day.</p>
<p>Lord, we know You hate sin. Yet, if sin had never been 
allowed, Your glory would not have been as manifest. Because of sin, we glorify 
You for the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. We will experience a greater 
good, having it better than Adam and Eve could have before the Fall. Right now, 
sin brings untold misery to all creation, but one day, You will work all things 
together for good.</p>
<p>So, today, Lord, may I be characterized by a reasonable 
optimism. Things are bad now, sometimes very bad, and I do not want to live in 
denial and justify that denial in the name of optimism. But I believe that 
one-day, things will be exactly as they should be. Then our present suffering 
will not be worthy to be compared to the glory that will be revealed to us.</p>
<p>Lord, today I am thankful, and I remember a few things for 
which to praise You: __________.</p>
<p>Help me, Lord, to develop a deeper hunger for You and Your 
Word. Please help me resist the temptations to find my main meaning in life 
apart from You.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the nation of Belarus. This former member 
of the Soviet Union has not fared well in many ways, including spiritually. The 
Orthodox Church and government restrict public evangelism and have passed laws 
preventing evangelicals from building church buildings within its cities. We 
pray that the tide will turn, and that the small 1.5% of evangelicals in this 
nation will multiply to over 10 percent within the next decade. Help the nation 
embrace complete religious freedom, may the believers there have a holy fervor 
for serving You.</p>
<p>Today we remember the Biblical Literature Fellowship, a 
ministry producing Christian literature in French to meet the needs of 
French-speaking Africans and other Francophones. Provide for them as they work 
with churches and missionaries. Guide the leadership by Your Spirit.</p>
<p>Lord, I remember the Marine Corps today. Help the men and 
women of the corps to stand for what is right, to seek You, and to feel 
appreciated by our nation.</p>
<p>Be my Rock this 
day, I pray, in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
