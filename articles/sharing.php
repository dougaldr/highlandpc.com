<br>Sharing: A Truly Radical Idea
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>When I was very young, about 4 or 5 (about 1960 or 61), I remember picking up
our telephone and hearing a conversation already in place. My mother instructed
me to hang it up&#151;it was the other family who shared our party line.<br>
<br>
Many of you have probably never heard of a party line. When telephones were
considered a luxury, folks would trim costs (and not &quot;max-out&quot; the
phone company's resources) by sharing a line. In our case, we shared a line with
a neighbor about four doors down. If you wanted to make a phone call and the
other person was already on the line, you would have to wait. If you had an
emergency (or, if they went on for hours and your patience ran thin), you could
break into the conversation and ask the chatters to yield. It could be
difficult, but more often than not, people learned to share.<br>
<br>
The church is NOT a private line, but a party line. Are you willing to share, or
must you have it your way?<br>
<br>
When our children were young and they each wanted to play with the same toy, we
would set a wind-up timer. Each one would have five minutes. When the bell rung,
they would have to share.<br>
<br>
The church is a family with many siblings. When the timer rings, are you willing
to let someone else have a turn?<br>
<br>
When I was a child, my parents taught me to share with my sister and friends.&nbsp;
When Marylu's younger sister came along, she had to share her bedroom. And when
I was in college studying electronics, we had to share the computer with
everyone else. We would punch in our cards (don't laugh) and hand them to the
person running the computer. Hours later, our program would be run.<br>
<br>
The church involves unexpected changes requiring sacrifice and patience. Am I
willing to let someone share my &quot;room&quot; with me? Am I willing to be
inconvenienced by others and give up some of my influence and control to
incorporate others? Will I share the &quot;computer&quot; patiently, or will I
resent it when someone sits in &quot;my pew?&quot;<br>
<br>
What's my point? Life involves sharing! This lesson we learn in childhood we
often forget in adulthood. Why do we think the concept of sharing should be
unnecessary in a church?<br>
<br>
In years gone by, new churches formed or old ones divided over differing
convictions. Doctrine, ethics, or church government were at the center of such
divisions. But as the years have gone by, more and more churches have split or
been planted because people refuse to share.<br>
<br>
Some of you may not realize how unusual our church is in this regards. We are a
church that repels people who refuse to share. Just as part of emotional
development involves growing from total self-centeredness to a love for and
willingness to consider others, so sharing with other believers is a sign of
spiritual maturity. It is part of what it means to love our brethren.&nbsp;
Terms
like: meekness, patience, forbearing with one another, edification, etc., all
imply the concept of sharing.<br>
<br>
Music, (called by Wiersbe the War Department of the church) is the ideal
illustration of this principle. The vast majority of Christians refuse to share
their musical preferences. The result: churches with all contemporary music but
sadly coupled with dumbed-down sermons, elderly churches with all traditional
music, or Dixie churches with all Southern Gospel music (to name a few). But
there are a few churches, like ours, who expect people to share. When you were a
child, you were told to share with your brothers and sisters. This is still good
advice for the church today. Share with your brothers and sisters!</p>

<p>You do not have to like it all&#151;but if you like some of it and others like
what you dislike (and vice-versa), you have a sharing situation. Be gracious
about what you do not prefer. But you'll get your turn up to bat too. One of our
distinctives as a church is that none of us always get our own way. We don't
have to have our own way. We believe in the out-dated concept of give and take.&nbsp;
That's what makes us different from the &quot;consumer church.&quot;<br>
<br>
Indeed, the principle of sharing is needed for so much of church life. Take the
matter of the pastor's attention. There are certain situations that require an
awful lot of attention from a pastor, meaning he cannot give as much attention
to other areas. For example, some pastors do little or no hospital visitation,
nor do they ever visit with shut-ins. Other pastors are virtually full-time
chaplains to the elderly but do no marital counseling nor relational or program
development. But a pastor in these hectic times needs to be there when he is
truly needed. He is not a social ornament or a good luck charm. But a true
shepherd needs to give attention to the hurting sheep&#151;not the bleating ones.&nbsp;
And he needs to concentrate on feeding the sheep, thereby preventing problems.&nbsp;
How does this translate? Many folks may want more attention, but real needs are
rarely neglected. When a real crisis occurs, hopefully he'll be there, whether
marital, relational, or physical in nature.<br>
<br>
In an age of demanding our own way, Christians need to be different. They must
learn how to share. Instead of independent agendas, we need to learn to look out
for the needs of the body. The wrong question to ask in making church-related
decisions is &quot;What do I want or like?&quot; The right question is,
&quot;What is best for the body?&quot;<br>
<br>
For further study: Read and think about
<a href="javascript:scripture('../scripture/rom1415.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Romans 14-16</a>. Meditate on <b> Romans
15:2</b>,
&quot;Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him
up...&quot; When was the last time you thought about meeting the needs of
someone outside of your &quot;pack?&quot; Are you part of a &quot;special
interest&quot; group, moaning about how you could use more attention, or are you
part of &quot;servants' group,&quot; concerned about others unlike yourself?&nbsp;
Do
you even try to understand those who differ from you? Are you willing to take
seriously the call to share? It doesn't come naturally to any of us, but it's
God's way.</p>
