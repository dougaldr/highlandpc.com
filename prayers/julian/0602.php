<p>Dear God,</p>
<p>Your Son called Himself the &quot;True Vine&quot; (<b>John 15:1</b>).  He meant 
we gain our nourishment through Him. As He said, &quot;Apart from me, you can do 
nothing.&quot; If we try to serve Him in our own power, we will not please Him. The 
kind of service He wants from us flows from our relationship, our connectedness, 
to Him. Then we can produce enduring and healthy fruit. Lord, we want qualities in 
our lives that glorify Him, expand His kingdom, and influence others to believe in 
Christ. We want to urge others to conform to Your will because of how we live. This 
is the foundational relationship of a meaningful life.</p>
<p>Lord, I remember what we call the Golden Rule, the words of 
our Savior in <b>Matthew 7:12</b>, “Do to others as you would have them do to 
you.&quot; This is so much easier to recite than to do. Remind me to put myself in 
other people's shoes and to determine what it is I should do, if anything. 
My goal is not to 
please people, but rather to determine what is in their best interest.</p>
<p>Father, I remember those individuals who are struggling with substance abuse: 
alcohol, illegal drugs, legal drugs, or other abuses. Father, although the road 
upward is slow, one step at a time, the road downward is a steep and slick slide. 
How easy it is to destroy a life because of an enslaving habit! This is certainly true 
of substance abuse, but also true of a variety of addictions. O Father, 
help Your children break free of these things. Bind Satan and his cohorts who promote 
these enslaving practices. Guide Your children to helpful resources and agencies. 
Offer them renewed hope and direction, I pray. Help me practice moderation, and 
remind me that I, too, am vulnerable.</p>
<p>I remember parents and their children. Lord, parents are crucial in the lives of those little ones entrusted to their care. May parents 
everywhere protect and train their children in humane and balanced ways. Help 
them to love their children, not to spoil them. May they  encourage them toward 
positive directions. We pray that Christian parents would prove to be 
consistent role models for their young ones. Send angels to protect them, I 
pray.</p>
<p>Lord, I pray for the Asian island republic of the 
Maldives. This nation is Islamic and the number of evangelical believers is 
miniscule. All forms of Christianity together make up less than .1% of the 
population and the practice of any religion other than Islam is forbidden. 
Although the government has tried to stop Christian radio broadcasts, the shortwave 
weekly one-half hour broadcast in the language of the Maldivians is spreading the 
good news. Lord, grant many there the repentance that leads to life!</p>
<p>
Thank You, Lord, for the Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry as they seek &quot;to 
glorify God by proclaiming His Word through the Internet to the unreached 
peoples of the Arab and Muslim world.... [They] commit to work diligently using all the tools provided on the 
Internet to win lost souls and establish believers in the precious faith.&quot; </p>
<p>
Lord, lay Your hand of blessing upon me and upon my loved ones today, I pray in 
the Name of Jesus, Amen.</p>
