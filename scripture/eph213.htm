<p><sup>1</sup> As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, <sup>2</sup>
in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the
ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are
disobedient.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> All of us also lived among them at one time gratifying
the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts.&nbsp; Like
the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.</p>
