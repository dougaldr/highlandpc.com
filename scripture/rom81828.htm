<p><sup>18</sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not 
worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
<sup>19</sup> The creation waits in eager expectation for the 
sons of God to be revealed. <sup>20</sup> For the creation was 
subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who 
subjected it, in hope <sup>21</sup> that the creation itself will be liberated from its 
bondage to decay and brought into 
the glorious freedom of the children of God. 
<p><sup>22</sup> We know that the whole creation has been 
groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
<sup>23</sup> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the 
firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as 
sons, the redemption of our bodies. <sup>24</sup> For in this 
hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what 
he already has? <sup>25</sup> But if we hope for what we do not 
yet have, we wait for it patiently. </p>
<p><sup>26</sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our 
weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself 
intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. <sup>27</sup> And he who 
searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the 
Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will. </p>
<p><sup>28</sup> And we know that in all things God works for 
the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</p>
