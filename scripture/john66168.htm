<p><sup>61</sup> Aware that his disciples were 
grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, &quot;Does this offend you?
<sup>62</sup> What if you see the Son of Man 
ascend to where he was before! <sup>63</sup> The 
Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you 
are spirit and they are life. <sup>64</sup> Yet there are 
some of you who do not believe.&quot; For Jesus had known from the beginning which of 
them did not believe and who would betray him.
<sup>65</sup> He went on to say, &quot;This is why I 
told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him.&quot; </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>66</sup> From this time many of his 
disciples turned back and no longer followed him. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>67</sup> &quot;You do not want to leave too, 
do you?&quot; Jesus asked the Twelve. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<sup>68</sup> Simon Peter answered him, 
&quot;Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.&quot;</p>
