<p>Lord Yahweh, </p>
<p>You are the Covenant-keeping God. You have 
kept Your covenant with mankind, the everlasting covenant made with Noah and his 
family. The rainbow reminds us that You will never again destroy the entire 
earth with a flood. You made a covenant with the children of Israel partly 
conditioned upon their obedience. Yet You also announced that You would make a 
New Covenant 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/jer313137.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Jeremiah 31:31-37</a>). 
Thank You that You have grafted in gentile 
believers into the blessings of this covenant. In Christ, we are now under the 
New Covenant as the law of God is written on our hearts. You are the God of the 
Covenant.</p>
<p>Lord, help me not to be a sensitive, touchy person. 
Neither allow me to have a hard heart. Instead help me to evaluate corrections 
and sincere criticism without punishing those who expose my weak points. Help 
me to be teachable not touchy; eager to grow not defensive.</p>
<p>Today I remember families who are struggling perhaps even 
my own. Lord, it is sometimes hard to get along. Sometimes some family 
members may not want to do Your will, at other times we may disagree as to what 
that will is. Please, Lord, bring peace and harmony to my family and the 
families of my friends at church, other friends and relatives. Help our homes 
become places of refuge not hotbeds of stress.</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may fill me. I&nbsp;choose to 
find my strength in His power not my own ability. I surrender the control of my 
life to Your Spirit.</p>
<p>Your Word tells me that if I confess my sins, You are faithful and&nbsp;just to 
forgive me those sins and You will purify me from all&nbsp;unrighteousness (<b>1 John 
1:9</b>). I accept responsibility for them and freely bring the sins Your Spirit 
brings to my mind now: __________.</p>
<p>I pray for the Central American nation of Guatemala. 
Though the population is very poor, thank You that the Gospel has prospered. 
Lord, it is exciting to see that over 26% of the population claims to be 
born-again evangelicals. We know that the indigenous church is now taking over responsibility to 
translate the Scriptures into the many remaining tribal languages without a 
translation. Help them to do a great job of it! And may the church continue to 
grow. May the number of evangelical Christians in Guatemala surpass the 50% 
mark! May Your Spirit nurture these believers to maturity.</p>
<p>Praise Your Name for Operation Mobilization's with &quot;over 4,000 people 
working in over 100 countries are serving with Operation Mobilization to bring a 
message of hope to the peoples of the world.... Working in every continent 
and on every ocean (via two ocean-going ships), Operation Mobilization seeks to 
demonstrate and proclaim the love of God.... Through literature, the creative 
arts, friendship, Bible studies, videos and cassette tapes, correspondence 
courses, relief and development work...by all means possible [they] will tell 
people how...lives have been changed...and how they can meet Jesus.&quot;</p>
<p>Empower these missionaries by Your Spirit, grant them 
harmony, safety, provision and Your wisdom.</p>
<p>I pray for the world's diplomats. I pray that they might 
find fair and peaceful solutions to the constant barrage of conflicts we face.</p>
<p>So I commit the next 24 hours to You, dear Lord, in Jesus' 
Name, Amen.</p>
