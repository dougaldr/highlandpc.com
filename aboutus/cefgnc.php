<p id="pgt">Our Child Evangelism Fellowship Good News Club</p>

<p>On Fridays during the school year, we conduct a 
<a href="https://www.cefonline.com/ministries/goodnewsclub/" target="offline" class="reg">Good News Club</a>
as an after-school activity
at a local elementary school. Participation is voluntary. We have about twenty-five
children in attendance. We teach the Gospel message in song, missionary story, Bible story, 
memory verse, and review game. We also feed the kids a snack and, when time allows, play 
games in the gym.</p>
<p>This is the first and sometimes only opportunity that many of the children have had to 
learn about the Gospel. We welcome you to lift us up in prayer so that we can make an impact for Christ.</p>
