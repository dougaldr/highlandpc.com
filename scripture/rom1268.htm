<p><sup>6</sup> We have different gifts, according to the grace given us.&nbsp; If a
man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith.&nbsp; <sup>7</sup>
If it is serving, let him serve, if it is teaching, let him teach; <sup>8</sup>
if it is encouraging, let him encourage, if it is contributing to the needs of
others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently;
if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.</p>
