<p><sup>18</sup> Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was
condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was
justification that brings life for all men.&nbsp; <sup>19</sup> For just as through
the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the
obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.&nbsp; <sup>20</sup> The law
was added so that the trespass might increase.&nbsp; But where sin increased, grace
increased all the more, <sup>21</sup> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so
also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord.</p>
