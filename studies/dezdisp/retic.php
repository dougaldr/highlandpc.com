<p>I do not like many movies, especially newer ones. Although Christian 
convictions would limit what and how much I watch, if I was lost I still would 
rarely watch movies. It is who I am. I am, for the most part, a movie dud.</p>
<p>I will watch Charlie Chan, or vintage mysteries and comedies, but not much 
recent. So, once in a while (maybe two or three times a year), my family tries 
to come up with a newer movie that even I will watch. In early 2006, they came 
with The Incredibles, though they had to twist my arm to get me to watch it with 
them. This year they came up with Chicken Run.</p>
<p>In this movie, the chickens want to learn how to fly so they escape the 
slaughter that is their destiny. But this raises a question: Why do chickens 
have wings?</p>
<p>The easy answer: Because God knew that we would love Buffalo wings. But 
there is a better answer.</p>
<p>&quot;There are at least two possibilities as to why flightless birds such as 
ostriches and emus have wings, either:</p>
<p>The wings are indeed &quot;useless&quot; and derived from birds that once could fly. 
This is possible in the creationist model. Loss of features is relatively easy 
by natural processes, whereas acquisition of new characters, requiring specific 
new DNA information, is impossible. Loss of wings most probably occurred in a 
beetle species that colonized a windy island. Again, this is a loss of genetic 
information, so it is not evidence for microbe-to-man evolution, which requires 
masses of new genetic information. </p>
<p>The wings have a function. Some possible functions, depending on the species 
of flightless bird, are: balance while running, cooling in hot weather, warmth 
in cold weather, protection of the ribcage during falls, mating rituals, scaring 
predators (emus will run at perceived enemies of their chicks, mouth open and 
wings flapping), sheltering of chicks, etc. If the wings are useless, why are 
the muscles functional, allowing these birds to move their wings?&quot; (source:

<p>Moses was a man who, in a sense, had wings but was flightless. He had 
tried to deliver the Hebrews in his own power and at his own time.</p>
<p>But now, God was going to recreate the pattern we saw when Moses left 
Egypt, but this time around, because it was God's time - and God had His 
blessing on Moses - he would succeed in bringing the Hebrews to freedom.</p>
<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>The same strategies that fail outside of God's timing can work 
wonderfully within God's timing.</u></p>
<p>The patterns we see before Moses left Egypt are repeated as Moses left Midian, 
but they now produce success because God's time is right.</p>

<li><p>Snuck away.</p></ol>
<li><p>The mission God had for him</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>Was not to visit friends.</p>
<li><p>It is probably true that he did want to visit family and friends, but he 
would not be going unless God had told him to do so…even then, he tried to 
wiggle out.</p></ol>

<ol type=1><li><p>When you dedicate something to God, it becomes holy.</p>
<li><p>God is so holy that when you give something to Him, it becomes holy.</p>
<li><p>Time watching a football time is not bad, but it is not holy either. Time 
reading your Bible becomes holy.</p></ol>
<li><p>God told Moses to tell Pharaoh that Israel was His Firstborn. (21-22)</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>The idea of being &quot;firstborn&quot; meant having special privileges and 
responsibilities.</p>
<li><p>Israel is not Yahweh's only son, but His firstborn, implying that there 
were other people groups who may have believed in Him; under the New Covenant, 
those people groups are included among the &quot;firstborn.&quot;</p>
<li><p><b>Hebrews 12:22-23</b> &quot;But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly 
Jerusalem, the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon thousands 
of angels in joyful assembly, to the church of the firstborn, whose names are 
written in heaven.&quot;</p></ol>
<li><p>God would destroy Egypt's firstborn. (23)</p></ol>
<li><p><b>Moses Barely Escapes Death Departing from Egypt and Midian.</b> (24-26)</p>
<ol type=A><li><p>Moses barely escaped Pharaoh; now God threatened to kill Moses. (24)</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>God probably appeared as The Angel of the Lord with sword in 
	hand.</p>
<li><p>Now Moses did not actually barely escape, only from a human perspective.</p>
<li><p>This was like Jacob wrestling all night with God, a lesson needed to be 
driven home.</p></ol>
<li><p>Moses' younger son had never been circumcised. (25)</p>
<ol type=1><li><p>The Midianites, who were descendents of Abraham, also practiced 
circumcision.</p>
<li><p>The events lead us to believe that Zipporah did not want her youngest son 
to go through circumcision and that Moses had been weak-willed and gave in to 
her.</p>
<li><p>Moses needed to learn to be the head of his home before he could be the 
head of his nation.</p></ol>
<li><p>The lesson was noted. (26)</p>
<li><p>This occurred at an inn.</p></ol>

<li><p><b>Moses Rejected by the Hebrews; Now Accepted.</b> (27-31)</p>

were in Egypt under Pharaoh?'&quot;</p>
<li><p>The Hebrew people believed Moses. (29-30)</p>

<p><b>Main Idea:</b> <u>The same strategies that fail outside of God's timing can work 
wonderfully within God's timing.</u></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>What can we learn from these events?</p>
<p>The importance of timing and waiting on God.</p>
<p>Some Christians just leap into decisions like they were the captains of 
their own ship; they feel no obligation to consult God, make no attempt to 
counsel with the godly, feel free to do whatever they want to do.</p>
<p>Such Christians have not discovered the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus asked, &quot;Why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?&quot; 
(<b>Luke 6:46</b>).</p>
<p>Let me lay some logic on you. God has revealed His will in His Word. How 
can we obey God, if we do not bother to check in with Him? And how can we check 
in with Him if we do not know His word? And how can we know His Word if we do 
not read and study it?</p>
<p>Moses tried things his way and failed. Moses was coerced to do things 
God's way and succeeded. Must we repeat this pattern? Do we have to learn the 
hard way, or can we, instead, get to know God in the first place?</p>
