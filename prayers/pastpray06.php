<br>Prayer #6
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>Our Father, we thank You that You are the God of 
Providence. Not only have You created all things, but You sustain, maintain, 
and set the course for the work of Your hands. </p>
<p>Not only do You govern the universe, but Your Son is &quot;the 
radiance of…&quot; Your &quot;…glory and the exact representation of…&quot; Your &quot;…being, 
sustaining all things by his powerful word&quot; (<b>Hebrews 1:3</b>).</p>
<p>You interact with Your creation, and You specially interact 
with those of us who are in Your new creation, being found righteous in Christ. 
We thank You that we stand clean before You, dressed in white garments, namely 
the righteousness of Christ. Therefore, through Him, we can enter your throne 
room with boldness.</p>
<p>Lord, when we look at our lives, we must confess that all 
is not well. Every one of us has qualities, habits, sins or weaknesses that we 
would love to get rid of, but they seem to hang on. To grow in You means to 
change, and change often comes the hard way. We wish we could snap our fingers 
and be fixed for ever. We know that when Jesus returns, we will be like Him and 
our inclination toward sin will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>But right now you want us to die to ourselves, to partake 
in the sufferings of Christ so that we might live the resurrection lifestyle 
now. Help us to nurture our walk with You, confident that You are working in us 
both to will and to do of Your good pleasure.</p>
<p>Lord, our families need You. Our friends and neighbors and 
co-workers and civic leaders—all of us need You desperately. Some of us are 
aware of that; others are oblivious. Oh, Father, through Your Spirit, convict 
those friends and family members and acquaintances who need Christ. Use us to 
reach them, we pray.</p>
<p>As a church family, sometimes it is hard for us to get 
along.&nbsp; We are offended, we feel our opinion doesn't count, or we cannot 
understand how people can see things differently than we do. Rather than be 
frustrated, help us to look not on our own things, but also upon the things of 
others. Help us to stop asking what we want, and instead to ask what is in 
the best interest of our church. Help us find our sense of self-worth by 
growing in You, not by demanding our own way.</p>
<p>Lord, we thank You that we extend our church's ministry by 
fellowshipping with missionaries and evangelists, both locally and abroad. 
Multiply our efforts to bring to the Gospel to all people. Expedite Bible 
translation, and may Your Spirit draw the masses to Yourself.</p>
<p>So Father, we bring You all our needs: the small troubles 
we have and the mighty burdens that weigh us down. We deposit them at Your 
feet, marveling that You want to help bear them. Change situations where 
appropriate, help us to accept situations that You are unwilling to change. In 
all, we trust Your wisdom and love.</p>
<p>For we pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p>
