<p><sup>1</sup> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted
by the devil.&nbsp; <sup>2</sup> After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was
hungry.&nbsp; <sup>3</sup> The tempter came to him and said, &quot;If you are the Son
of God, tell these stones to become bread.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>4</sup> Jesus answered, &quot;It is written 'Man does not live on bread
alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'&quot;</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on
the highest point of the temple.&nbsp; <sup>6</sup> &quot;If you are the Son of
God,&quot; he said, &quot;throw yourself down.&nbsp; For it is written:</p>

<p>'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in
their hands, so that you will not strike your food against a stone.'&quot;</p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Jesus answered him, &quot;It is also written: 'Do not put the
Lord your God to the test'&quot;</p>

<p><sup>8</sup> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him
all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.&nbsp; <sup>9</sup> &quot;All this I
will give you,&quot; he said, &quot;if you will bow down and worship me.&quot;</p>

<p><sup>10</sup> Jesus said to him, &quot;Away from me, Satan! For it is
written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'&quot;</p>

<p><sup>11</sup> Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</p>
