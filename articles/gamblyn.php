<br>Gambling: Right or Wrong?
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>On August 6th we held a &quot;Youth Forum&quot; involving leaders from
B.A.S.I.C. Youth Group, Awana JV's, the teen Sunday School class, and parents
who had researched subject matter. We tried to put together a master list
of subjects we wanted covered somewhere in our youth program. Many of the
subjects listed struck a chord in my mind. I thought to myself,
&quot;Vasicek, you need to deal with some of these matters for our adult members
as well.&quot; One subject I realized I had rarely addressed was gambling.</p>
<p>While I have many faults and am by no means sinless, gambling has never been
much of a temptation to me. Before I was saved, I used to gamble small
amounts at the racetrack or with cards, but it never did much for me. I
cannot say the same for my family. My dad was a frequent gambler, and one
of my uncles tried to earn a living through gambling at horse racing. A
young man who had been my best friend was arrested once for illegal gambling.</p>
<p>Although I have done no gambling since I became a Christian at age 17, I have
known of many professing Christians who do gamble. What gambling does to a
society is not my focus here: I want to look at gambling and the serious
believer. What does God say about gambling? Nothing&#8212;directly. But I
believe His Word offers much about this subject&#8212;indirectly. Put another
way, I think we can conclude that at least most of what we call gambling is not
God's preferred lifestyle for His disciples. We may draw this conclusion
by looking <b>not</b> at commands that address gambling since there is no
&quot;You shall not gamble!&quot; statement in Scripture, but at related
commands or principles God gives us. Judge for yourselves whether I have
applied these principles accurately and fairly.</p>
<p>First, note these statistics:
   <ol><li>In a recent survey of high school students, 50% said they had
gambled at least once a year.

     <li>A magazine predicts: &quot;...gambling will be a major form of
teenage recreation in the United States.&quot;
     <li>&quot;We will face, in the next decade or so, more problems
with youth gambling than we'll face in the next decade with drug use.&quot;</p>
     <li>Teenage gamblers abuse drugs and alcohol 2.5 times more than
their peers do.</ol>
<p>We must not only discourage our young people from gambling, we must act
accordingly. If it is wrong for a seventeen-year-old to gamble away his
meager paycheck, then is it right for a seventy-year-old to hit the machines in
Vegas? What is so wrong about gambling?</p>
<p>Because I try to be honest, I must admit that some forms of gambling may be
harmless. People who play poker for pennies or occasionally buy a lottery
ticket do not top my list of depraved persons. Although I am probably at
an extreme end here, I personally will not even accept a free lottery ticket,
but I do sometimes buy a raffle ticket for a charitable cause. I will not
allow gambling for even pennies in my family (chips or grains of popcorn are
okay). I do not condemn believers who play for pennies: I recognize that I
may be reacting more out of emotion than reason because I have seen what
gambling can do.</p>
<p>I do not think that gambling is wrong because it involves chance.&nbsp;
Chance is not necessarily evil, nor is it tempting God. Tossing a coin has
solved many arguments.</p>
<p>I do not think that gambling is wrong because it is fun. Some
Christians are suspicious of anything enjoyable. Not me. I wasn't
baptized in vinegar.</p>
<p>I do not think gambling is wrong because I had some great-grandfather who was
a devout Christian and he said it was wrong. (I might be the first saved
Vasicek in hundreds of years for all I know). Nor do I think that gambling
is wrong because I was brought up that way. I wasn't. Tradition has
nothing to do with it. I think most or all gambling is wrong because it
frequently violates the following Scriptural principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>You shall not covet. At the heart of gambling is often a desire to
pick up money fast&#8212;without work, investment, or service.
<p><b>Proverbs 13:11</b> reads, &quot;Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers
money little by little makes it grow.&quot; We might argue whether money
won in gambling is dishonest, but it is clear that the way to build finances is
&quot;slow and steady.&quot;</p>
<li>The Bible tells us to nurture contentment. At the heart of gambling
are discontentment and the lure of a quick fix. Gambling nurtures
discontentment.<br>
<li>Gambling is exploiting others and violates the command to &quot;love our
neighbor as ourselves.&quot; This is perhaps the greatest reason of all
for avoiding it. Gambling is not the same as risk-taking or investing.&nbsp;
If you invest money in penny stocks and the company folds, you have lost money.&nbsp;
If the company succeeds, you earn money, but not necessarily at another's
expense. Gambling, on the other hand, demands winners and losers.&nbsp;
For you to win $1,000, others must lose that amount (plus the amount that the
track or bookie takes out, which often is used to support organized crime).
<p>What has determined who wins and loses? The way a company is managed?&nbsp;
How hard people work? No. Pure chance. Does loss or gain come
slowly, with a chance to prepare? No, loss strikes like sudden tragedy.</p>
<li>Gambling is highly addictive. As human beings, there are things we
do as a normal part of life&#8212;things that can easily become addictive: eating can
become gluttony, normal sexuality can become sexual addiction, talking can turn
into habitual gossip or complaining, and work can turn into workaholism.&nbsp;
Frankly, we do not need to look for more things to be addicted to.
</ol>
<p>Do you remember the old &quot;Superman&quot; show? The star of the show
eventually committed suicide to escape gambling debts. I have known many
people whose lives have been adversely affected by gambling. So why go
there?</p>
<p>Sometimes the world is more honest about right and wrong than rationalizing
Christians. That's why they call Las Vegas, &quot;Sin City.&quot;&nbsp;
Maybe they are on to something.</p>
<p>Am I saying that it is wrong to visit Las Vegas? No. But I am
saying that somehow I cannot imagine Jesus gambling. The Jesus of the
Scriptures is not the killjoy Jesus portrayed by some. Many Christians
might be uncomfortable in some environments in which Jesus placed Himself.&nbsp;
Jesus had lots of fun times at weddings, celebrations, and festivals.&nbsp;
Would He ever buy a lottery ticket? I have an opinion but can't say one or
the other with dogmatism. But gambling on the riverboats, roulette tables, or at
the Vegas machines&#8212;I don't think so. I do feel dogmatic about that.&nbsp;
Maybe I'm not seeing something, maybe my mind is narrow. But when I ask
the WWJD question&#8212;&quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;&#8212;it seems a no-brainer to me.
