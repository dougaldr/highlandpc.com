<p><sup>36</sup> Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place 
called Gethsemane, and he said to them, “Sit here while I go over there and 
pray.” <sup>37</sup> He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee 
along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
<sup>38</sup> Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed 
with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.” </p>
<p><sup>39</sup> Going a little farther, he fell with his 
face to the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be 
taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.” </p>
<p><sup>40</sup> Then he returned to his disciples and found 
them sleeping. “Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked 
Peter. <sup>41</sup> “Watch and pray so that you will not fall 
into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” </p>
<p><sup>42</sup> He went away a second time and prayed, “My 
Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, 
may your will be done.” </p>
<p><sup>43</sup> When he came back, he again found them 
sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. <sup>44</sup> So he 
left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same 
thing. </p>
<p><sup>45</sup> Then he returned to the disciples and said 
to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the 
Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. <sup>46</sup> Rise, 
let us go! Here comes my betrayer!” </p>
