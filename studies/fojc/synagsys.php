<br>The Synagogue System and Early Christianity

<p>When we read about 
Jairus, he is described as &quot;a ruler of the synagogue&quot; in Capernaum. Christ 
often frequented and taught in this synagogue, and it appears that Jairus had 
been won to faith in Jesus as the Messiah, perhaps from those teaching 
experiences.</p>
<p>God nowhere 
instituted the synagogue. For the better part of Israel&#039;s first millennium as a 
nation, they had no synagogue. The synagogue appeared after the Jews returned 
from Babylon, perhaps having been developed during the captivity. Its purpose? 
For the Jews to have a system to indoctrinate their people (and hold one another 
accountable). Jesus patronized and seemed to approve of the synagogue concept.</p>
<p>Synagogue leaders 
were lay leaders in the sense that they were not generally paid for services 
rendered. Modern synagogues have carried over some of these traditional methods 
of organization, but often employ professional, full-time clergy (Rabbis) and 
often hire professional Cantors as well. </p>
<p>We will look at 
some of the similarities between the ancient synagogue officers and the ancient 
offices of the Church (most of this material comes from <u>Yeshua: A Guide to 
the Real Jesus and the Original Church</u> by Ron Moseley or <u>Unger's Bible 
Handbook</u> by Merrill Unger).</p>
<p>The main leader of 
the synagogue was called the President (the <i>nasi</i>). He was a general 
supervisor of all synagogue activities. Modern synagogues also have a 
&quot;president.&quot; Within Christianity, even as late as AD 150, the leader of a 
church congregation was called the &quot;president&quot; rather than the &quot;pastor.&quot; This 
is probably the position Jairus held.</p>
<p>Ron Moseley 
mentions a second officer: &quot;…a public minister of the synagogue called a <i>
chazen</i> who prayed, preached behind a wooden pulpit, and took care of the 
general oversight of the reading of the Law and other congregational duties. He 
did not read the Law, but stood by the one who did, to correct and oversee, 
ensuring that it was done properly.&quot; Moseley argues that this office was 
sometimes referred to as, &quot;overseer of the congregation, angel of the church, 
and minister of the synagogue.&quot; Unger tells us that he was also responsible to 
administer the discipline of scourging when appropriate.</p>
<p>A third main 
office involved three men called <i>gabbay tzedikah</i>, &quot;the receivers of 
alms.&quot; They would receive and distribute benevolent gifts and answer questions 
about the Law. Modern Judaism refers to these officers as elders.</p>
<p>These were the 
three main officers of the synagogue, and, though not exactly coordinated with 
New Testament offices, you can see the functions associated with the New 
Testament Elder (including preaching/teaching elders) and the office of Deacon.</p>
<p>Other positions 
included the <i>shaliach</i>, the announcer, the <i>maggid</i>, a migratory 
evangelist, the <i>batlanim</i>, a scholar who was either independently wealthy 
or receiving support, the <i>zakin</i>, an older wise man (over 50) who offered 
to counsel younger people, the <i>rabbi</i>, who was considered a sort of 
prophet who read the Word, preached it, and exhorted the people, and the <i>
meturganim</i> who interpreted the ancient Hebrew into current language (as well 
as, &quot;adding to the meaning…&quot;).</p>
<p>When you 
contemplate these offices, you can see how they prefigure both the offices of 
the New Testament and some of the spiritual gifts mentioned by the Apostles. 
Although the early church was not <b>exactly</b> modeled after the synagogue, <i>
it was organized along similar lines</i>. In a <i>limited</i> sense, we can 
better understand the church of Jesus Christ by improving our understanding of 
the first century synagogue community.</p>
