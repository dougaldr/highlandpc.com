<br>How Are Your Percentages?
<br><span class=byln>by Ed Vasicek</span></p>

<p>When I pastored in the midst of Chicago, our small church was very
evangelistic. About thirty folks in our church of fifty were saved in the four
and a half years I served there. I led many of them to Christ myself.&nbsp;
I also saw
more professions that did not materialize into church attendance.<br>
<br>
When I came to Kokomo in 1983, I could immediately sense that things were
different. Many people professed Christ, but the level of spiritual maturity in
the lives of believers was lower than I had been accustomed to seeing. In the
Chicago neighborhood, born-again believers were scarce and attending an
evangelical church carried a stigma that only the serious were willing to bear.<br>
<br>
I wasn't here long before I concluded that this area did not need more
evangelism AS MUCH as it needed an approach that would help Christians become
more serious about their faith and pace of growth. The statistics of respected
Christian pollster, George Barna, confirmed my observations and conclusions.&nbsp;
He
claims that about 41% of Americans fit the definition of a born-again Christian.&nbsp;
This is higher in the South (and I believe Kokomo matches the South in this
statistic) where 59% are described as those who believe they are going to heaven
because they have accepted Jesus Christ as Savior. Let's say for purposes of
discussion that our area has a 50% born-again rate. However, of that 50%, only
8% fit the definition of being &quot;evangelical.&quot; Barna defines an
evangelical as one who believes he is responsible to share his faith and holds
to a few of the fundamentals of the faith, such as the existence of the Holy
Spirit and Satan, the sinlessness of Christ, etc. Absent from his broad
definition of an evangelical are important beliefs like the Trinity.<br>
<br>
Even with Barna's broad definition of &quot;evangelical, only one fifth of
born-again believers hold to all the fundamentals of the faith that he listed.&nbsp;
For example, 53% of born-again people do not believe the Holy Spirit exists; 47%
do not believe Satan is an actual being but think he is symbolic of evil; 24%
think Jesus sinned; 31% believe you can earn your way to heaven; and 30% do not
believe in the literal resurrection of Christ. These percentages are not
percentages of Americans, but percentages of born-again believers.<br>
<br>
If we add the other fundamentals of the faith, for example, the two natures of
Christ, His return to rule, and the Trinity, the level might fall below 5%.&nbsp;
Add
to this a minimal level of knowledge&#151;being able to lead someone to Christ,
listing the Ten Commandments, having read through the Bible at least once&#151;as
well as attending church regularly, and the level might drop to 2%. My guesses
might be inaccurate, but I can't be off too far.<br>
<br>
The focus of Highland Park Church has been primarily to bring born-again
Christians from the 50% into the 2%. Along the way, we surely want to continue
to add to the 50% through evangelism, but Christ told us to make disciples, not
merely add numbers. Disciples are disciplined followers who are anxious to
learn. As a church, we want to emphasize learning, not feeling, discipline, not
intensity of experience. We want to be part of the solution.<br>
<br>
As a pastor, my priority has always been discipleship. Although the word
&quot;discipleship&quot; has become associated with programs or one-on-one
meetings, such is not the intent of the word. For centuries, churches made
disciples without study guides. Study guides and programs are helpful&#151;often
very helpful, but do not limit your understanding of discipleship to them.&nbsp;
Much
discipleship can come through group meetings. A good sermon helps to disciple as
does a Sunday School class and Awana. Believers ministering together helps to
disciple and &quot;apprentice&quot; others. Reading good books, reading through
the Bible with LEAP 2000, and listening to WIWC are wonderful avenues of
discipleship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a sense, much of Highland Park Church's ministry is one gigantic
discipleship program, but it only works if you pour your heart into it. Are you
in the process of becoming a member of the 2%?&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you take your faith
seriously, to the point that you are anxious to learn and develop good spiritual
habits? Wouldn't it be great if we could see that 2% grow to 3, 4, and 5% in our
community? It could happen, but it must begin with us.</p>
