<p>My Father,</p>
<p>You are the God of Providence. You coax history along in 
directions that fulfill Your purposes. We might view some of these events as 
coincidence or good fortune, but we know that You are working in human history 
to accomplish Your divine ends. You are certainly and truly the God of 
Providence, a God Whose guiding hand cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>Lord, help me to be a kind person. I did not ask you to 
help me to be nice for niceness implies being a people-pleaser. Instead You 
want me to be kind. In being both kind and true, I will indeed win the favor of 
many people—but not all. But more importantly I will please You 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/prov334.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Proverbs 3:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>Thank You that my soul will live forever. When my body 
dies, to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. One day when 
He returns to the clouds, Jesus will resurrect my body into an incorruptible one 
like His.</p>
<p>Help me with my thought life today. Help me think positive 
and pleasant thoughts today, thoughts that please You.</p>
<p>Lord, I am thankful for many things, three of which are: __________.</p>
<p>Lord, I empty myself before You so that Your Spirit may 
fill me. I find my strength in His power not my own. May Your Spirit control 
me&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Please address the following needs in my life or the lives 
of my friends: __________.</p>
<p>Today I remember the Russian province of Chechnya. 
Although many of these people want their region to be independent, the Russian 
government opposes this move. Chechnya has often been devastated by war and 
they have devastated others by terrorism. Lord, we pray for peace in this 
region. We also pray that Your Spirit would move and that the very few 
believers in Chechnya would grow and grow. We pray that the Russian evangelical 
church would also grow by leaps and bounds, that You would raise up strong 
leaders in both groups and that the rest of those societies would learn to 
respect born-again Christians. We know Chechnya with its heavy Muslim 
population is particularly difficult to reach. Use the Jesus film and other 
means, but most of all may Your Spirit do a great work there.</p>
<p>Thank You for Bethany International, an organization that, 
“exists to delight God's heart and extend His Kingdom by training and sending 
servant leaders to disciple the least reached. We outfit men and women for 
missions through Bethany College of Missions in Minneapolis and through more 
than 40 sister schools and partner ministries worldwide. More than 125 
missionaries disciple the least reached in 29 countries through Bethany 
International Ministries (formerly called Bethany Fellowship Missions).” 
Father, we pray that You would prosper the attempts of this organization, 
provide harmony among the workers, provide for them and empower them by Your 
Spirit. Send angels to protect them and Your Spirit’s wisdom to direct them.</p>
<p>Lord, bless financial analysts and financial planners. Help 
them to be honest, competent and may those in this field who know You share 
their faith with their peers and clients.</p>
<p>Now, good God, 
keep my heart from straying, I pray, in Jesus’ Name, Amen.</p>
