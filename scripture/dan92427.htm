<p><sup>24</sup> Seventy &quot;sevens&quot; are decreed for your people and your
holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for
wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and
prophecy and to anoint the most holy.</p>

<p><sup>25</sup> Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to
restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there
will be seven &quot;sevens,&quot; and sixty-two &quot;sevens.&quot;&nbsp; It will be
rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.&nbsp; <sup>26</sup> After
the sixty-two &quot;sevens,&quot; the Anointed One will be cut off and will have
nothing.&nbsp; The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the
sanctuary.&nbsp; The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and
desolations have been decreed.&nbsp; <sup>27</sup> He will confirm a covenant with
many for one &quot;seven.&quot;&nbsp; In the middle of the &quot;seven&quot; he will
put an end to sacrifice and offering.&nbsp; And on a wind of the temple, he will set
up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is
poured out on him.</p>
