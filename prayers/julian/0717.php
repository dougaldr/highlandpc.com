<p>My exalted God,</p>
<p>Lord, You have a mighty hand. You do not have a physical 
body, for Jesus taught us that &quot;God is Spirit.&quot; Even though God the Son is 
forever one with human nature of Jesus and thus has a glorified body, Your 
essence is spiritual not physical. Being in Your image does not mean we look 
like You, but rather that we too have a spiritual existence—in addition to 
our physical bodies. So when You speak of Your hand, You mean Your decisive 
power. Since You are infinite, so are Your resources. Your word also talks 
about us dwelling under Your wings 
(<a href="javascript:scripture('../../scripture/ps914.htm')" target=_self class=pop>Psalm 91:4</a>). 
This does not mean that You have physical wings, but it pictures the reality 
that You are a shelter for us.</p>
<p>Lord, I have some disappointments and burdens in life. I 
have to find refuge under Your wings and need Your mighty hand to work in my 
life. Some hurts are deep and have left scars including: __________.</p>
<p>I turn them over to You. Help me to find Your purpose and joy in life. There 
are many things I cannot change, but I can share all my&nbsp;thoughts with You. You 
are a God Who feels with me. You help me to go on and grow and direct my 
attention elsewhere, while at the same time not pressuring me to &quot;get over 
it.&quot;</p>
<p>I remember parents. Lord. Parents are so important to 
those little ones entrusted to their care. May parents everywhere protect and 
train their children in humane and balanced ways. Help them to love their 
children, not to spoil them, and to encourage them toward positive directions. 
We pray that Christian parents would prove to be consistent role models for 
their young ones. Send angels to protect them, I pray.</p>
<p>Lord, I thank You for the work You are doing in the Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. These people are related to the Thais and 
there are hundreds of local languages in this region populated by 48 million 
people. Perhaps 1% of the population professes some sort of Christianity, 
mostly evangelical. Thank You that the number of Christians has grown tenfold 
over the last half-century. Lord, I pray that the church would multiply by ten 
again over the next decade! Father, help the government to stop persecuting 
Christianity in this region and throughout China. May genuine freedom of 
religion replace the oppressive regulations now in place, I ask.</p>
<p>I pray for MECCO Middle East Christian Outreach. Bless them 
as they seek to nurture evangelism, discipleship, servanthood and prayer within 
evangelical Middle Eastern churches. Their burden is to reach the main &quot;21 
cities with populations of over a million people, including some of the world's 
largest: Cairo (10m+), Tehran (8m+), Istanbul (8m+), Baghdad (nearly 5m), 
Alexandria (3m+) and Ankara (nearly 3m).&quot; They are also burdened to work among 
&quot;the refugees meeting physical needs, ...demonstrating God's love and grace.&quot; 
O Lord, bless this mission's work. Empower them with Your Spirit, grant them 
harmony among themselves, safety, wisdom, provision and great fruit for their 
labor.</p>
<p>Lord, may I labor for You today, I ask in Jesus' Name, 
Amen.</p>
