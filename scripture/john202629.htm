<p><sup>26</sup> A week later his disciples were in the house 
again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and 
stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” <sup>27</sup> Then 
he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and 
put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.” </p>
<p><sup>28</sup> Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
</p>
<p><sup>29</sup> Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen 
me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have 
believed.” </p>
