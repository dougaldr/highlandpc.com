<p><sup>1</sup>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not
love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. <sup>2</sup>If I have
the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I
have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup>If
I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have
not love, I gain nothing.</p>

<p><sup>4</sup>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not
boast, it is not proud. <sup>5</sup>It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it
is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. <sup>6</sup>Love does not
delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. <sup>7</sup>It always protects,
always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.</p>

<p><sup>8</sup>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will
cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge,
it will pass away. <sup>9</sup>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, <sup>10</sup>but
when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. <sup>11</sup>When I was a
child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.
When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. <sup>12</sup>Now we see but
a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in
part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>

<p><sup>13</sup>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the
greatest of these is love.</p>
